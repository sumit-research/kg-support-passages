<TEXT>Intro
Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed {{ self-governance }} societies based on voluntary institutions.  These are often described as stateless societies {{ stateless society }} , although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical {{ Hierarchy }} free associations {{ Free association (communism and anarchism) }} .  Anarchism holds the state {{ state (polity) }} to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.  While anti-statism is central, anarchism generally entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation {{ hierarchical organization }} in the conduct of all human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.  Other forms of authority it opposes include patriarchal authority, economic domination through private property, and racist supremacy.  Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy {{ anarchist law }} reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations {{ Libertarian socialism }} of communism {{ anarcho-communism }} , collectivism {{ collectivist anarchism }} , syndicalism {{ anarcho-syndicalism }} , mutualism {{ Mutualism (economic theory) }} , or participatory economics.  Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.  Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive.  Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.  Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social {{ social anarchism }} and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
Etymology and terminology
The term anarchism {{ wikt:anarchism }} is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix -ism, themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i. e.  anarchy (from , anarchos, meaning "one without rulers"; from the privative prefix ἀν {{ privative alpha }} - (an-, i. e.  "without") and , archos, i. e.  "leader", "ruler"; (cf.  archon or , arkhē, i. e.  "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy") ) and the suffix or (-ismos, -isma, from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, -izein).  The first known use of this word was in 1539.  Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as Robespierre {{ Maximilien de Robespierre }} did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.  There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.  The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.  Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.  On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism.
Anarchist schools of thought
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution.  The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i. e.  opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve ones potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognising equality of entitlement".  In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after. Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.  A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state {{ minarchism }} as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.  One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.  In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i. e.  collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Internal issues and debates
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.  The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism {{ anarchism and nationalism }} , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.  Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism {{ Anarchism and Marxism }} , communism {{ Issues in anarchism#Communism }} , collectivism, syndicalism/trade unionism, and capitalism.  Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism {{ veganarchism }} or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as civilisation, technology (e. g.  within anarcho-primitivism), and the democratic process {{ Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy }} may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. On a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e. g.  the Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography {{ Crypto-anarchism }} to bring about an anarchist society.  About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.  The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
Topics of interest
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Criticisms
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.  Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.

Origins
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist {{ Taoism }} philosopher Laozi, and in later centuries by Zhuangzi {{ Zhuang Zhou }} and Bao Jingyan.  Zhuangzis philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.  Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.  A great brigand {{ wikt:brigand }} becomes a ruler of a Nation. " Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics {{ Cynicism (philosophy) }} , and their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.  Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist {{ Christian anarchism }} tradition.  Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ {{ Christ (title) }} and nbsp;.  the first anarchist society was that of the apostles {{ Apostle (Christian) }} . " In early Islamic history {{ History of Islam }} , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war {{ Second Fitna }} over the Caliphate, where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.  Later, some Muslim scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and Abu Hanifa, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralised authorities of the emirs.  But such interpretations reverberate subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible {{ Anarchism and religion }} .  This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.  The French renaissance {{ Renaissance humanism }} political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.  The radical Protestant Christian {{ Protestant Christianity }} Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.  The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse {{ Pejorative }} , used by Royalists {{ Cavalier }} against their Roundhead opponents.  By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the Enragés, began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin {{ Jacobin (politics) }} centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.  By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.  Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment {{ Age of Enlightenment }} , particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseaus arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.  As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.  Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.   Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism.  He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.  He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force.  Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power.  Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.  His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the peoples mental enslavement, the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage.  He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.  In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement. The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, What is Property?, published in 1840.  It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.  He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order. " In What is Property? Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "Property is theft. " In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" (propriété), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.  He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use.  Later, however, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.  His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time. The anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian".  Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature. " In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book, The Ego and Its Own, which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism.  French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon.
First International and the Paris Commune
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.  After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.  In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas.  The Catalan {{ Catalan people }} politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhons works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party.  According to George Woodcock "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s. " According to the Encyclopædia Britannica "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralised, or "cantonalist," political system {{ Cantonal Revolution }} on Proudhonian lines. " In 1864 the International Workingmens Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists {{ Blanquism }} , Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.  Due to its links to active workers movements, the International became a significant organisation.  Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council.  Proudhons followers, the mutualists, opposed Marxs state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.  Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B.  Greene had been members of the First International.  In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).  They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction.  Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.  Mikhail Bakunin characterised Marxs ideas as centralist {{ centralism }} and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.  Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.  One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunins Swiss supporters.  Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Councils resolutions passed almost unanimously.  Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers. " In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress {{ Hague Congress (1872) }} , where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.  In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St.  Imier Congress {{ Anarchist St.  Imier International }} , adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.  The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871.  The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.  Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.  They included Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers, and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards).  As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised nbsp;.  Moreover, the Communes ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas.  Indeed, the Communes vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunins and Proudhons ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 nbsp;.  and for federation of communes).  Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.  George Woodcock states:
Organised labour
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour. " In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day {{ Eight-hour day }} would become standard.   In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event.  On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.  The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicagos Haymarket Square.  A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.  In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.  Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.  Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.  The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.  Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.  The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day.  In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.  The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.  Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international workers holiday.  In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen.  Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism.  A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism).  Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.  He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist {{ reformism }} and even conservative {{ Conservatism }} , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.  Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.  The Spanish Workers Federation {{ Federación Anarquista Ibérica }} in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.  The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.  Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1. 58 nbsp;million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.  The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.  In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico {{ Anarchism in Mexico }} , Brazil {{ Anarchism in Brazil }} , Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C. N. T.  as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation.  The largest and most militant of these organisations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina nbsp;.  it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions. "
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism
Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda. " Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during heightened government repression and labor conflicts where workers were killed.  However, Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents.  Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion. " Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: The Science of Revolutionary Warfare, a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives, based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.  By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides.  From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations {{ Confiscation }} . " Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.  Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt. ".  Frances Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.  Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".  A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.  The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter. " State repression {{ Political repression }} (including the infamous 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts.  The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.  Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar Alexander II of Russia, President Sadi Carnot {{ Marie François Sadi Carnot }} of France, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President William McKinley of the United States, King Carlos I of Portugal and King George I of Greece.  McKinleys assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.  Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the 1917 October Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February {{ February Revolution }} and October revolutions {{ October Revolution }} , and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.  However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed.  Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine.  There, in the Free Territory {{ Free Territory (Ukraine) }} , they fought in the civil war {{ Russian Civil War }} against the Whites {{ White movement }} (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months. Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.  Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised.  For them, Bakunins predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.  Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties {{ Communist party }} grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.  In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT {{ Confédération générale du travail }} and IWW {{ Industrial Workers of the World }} left the organisations and joined the Communist International {{ Comintern }} .  The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 {{ Revolutions of 1917–23 }} saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism.  In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer, Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist {{ Council communism }} structures.  In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus Umanita Nova, its daily paper) grew accordingly nbsp;.  Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.  In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón.  In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.  Their 1926 manifesto, called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) {{ Platformism }} , was supported.  Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists {{ NEFAC }} of North America.  Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.  In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure.  It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchisms conflict with the state.  Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists.  Italian anarchists {{ Anarchism in Italy }} played a key role in the anti-fascist {{ Anti-fascism }} organisation Arditi del Popolo, which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.  The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution. " In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots {{ 6 February 1934 crisis }} , anarchists divided over a united front policy.  Anarchists in France {{ Anarchism in France }} and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II.  In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin.  Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister {{ Propagandaministerium }} , labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives. " Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg.  On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp {{ Nazi concentration camps }} at Oranienburg {{ Oranienburg concentration camp }} when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.  But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.  Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).  In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired {{ Anarchism in Spain }} movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised {{ Collective farming }} the land.  But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists {{ Stalinism }} , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.  According to Noam Chomsky, "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists.  Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere.  The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler.  That, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic.  They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves. " The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon {{ Anarchist Aragon }} , Andalusia, and parts of the Levante {{ Levante, Spain }} .  Much of Spains economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain {{ Communist Party of Spain (main) }} influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment.  Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian {{ agriculture }} areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes {{ commune (intentional community) }} .  Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history. " Spanish Communist Party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists {{ Workers Party of Marxist Unification }} and anarchists.  The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.  The city of Madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist Melchor Rodríguez García.
Post-war years
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy {{ Anarchism in Italy#Postwar years and today }} and France {{ Anarchism in France#The Fourth Republic (1945–1958) }} .  The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District.  In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association).  From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.  In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist {{ Synthesist anarchism }} Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy.  Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded.  An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948.  After World War II, an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists {{ Anarchism in Germany }} and called for Americans to support them.  By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation.  The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, Die Freie Gesellschaft, which survived until 1953.  In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded.  In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.  The Syndicalist Workers Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federations earliest predecessors.  It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.  Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.  Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as Albert Camus, Herbert Read, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, George Woodcock, Leopold Kohr, Julian Beck, John Cage and the French Surrealist {{ Surrealism }} group led by André Breton, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.  Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day.  Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War. " The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Grahams Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977).
Contemporary anarchism
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.  Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts {{ Protests of 1968 }} .  In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste {{ Fédération anarchiste }} ), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.  In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols.  The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.  In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.  Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.  Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.  Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous {{ Traditional knowledge }} , feminist {{ feminism }} , ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.  Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.  Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight {{ G8 }} , and the World Economic Forum.  Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police.  These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.  A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999 {{ World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity }} .  According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism nbsp;.  One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally. " International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT.  CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.  Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the Unione Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation {{ Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) }} .  The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 3,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
Post-classical schools of thought
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic {{ Syncretic politics }} , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.  Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology. Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism.  It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association.  Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state.  In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.  L.  Susan Brown claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".  Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre. Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence).  It developed "mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".  Christian anarchism is a movement {{ Christian movement }} in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity.  Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy, Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy, and Jacques Ellul. Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Trudas Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft).  The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists {{ Anarchism in Russia }} in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.  The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movements failures during the Russian Revolution. Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.  In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and Sébastien Faure.  It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.  Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchisms relationship to traditional Left-wing politics.  Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality.  Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.  Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice.  It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.  Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation.  Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.  Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and postcolonialism. Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.  Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty {{ sovereign individual }} in a free market.  Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory.  There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement, due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible {{ Anarchism and capitalism }} with capitalist forms.
Free love
An important current within anarchism is free love.  Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individuals sovereignty.  Free love particularly stressed womens rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.  The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker, but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywoods The Word {{ The Word (free love) }} (1872–1890, 1892–1893).  Free Society (1895–1897 as The Firebrand; 1897–1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.  The publication advocated free love and womens rights, and critiqued "Comstockery" – censorship of sexual information.  Also M.  E.  Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.  In New York Citys Greenwich Village, bohemian {{ Bohemianism }} feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now.  They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical Edna St.  Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them.  Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others.  Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.  Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public. " In fact, before Goldman, heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal Der arme Teufel (English: The Poor Devil).  In Argentina anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called (English: The Womans Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.  In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand.  He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults.  He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.  In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.  Mujeres Libres was an anarchist womens organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women.  It was founded in 1936 by Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members.  The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for womens liberation {{ Feminist movement }} and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel.  In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.  Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism.  She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment. More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex.  The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire (2000) and Linvention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought
, Catalan anarchist pedagogue and free-thinker]] For English anarchist William Godwin education was "the main means by which change would be achieved. " Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.  For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the childs autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the childs own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the childs capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school. " In his Political Justice he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".  Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established.  Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education.  In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation.  Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters nbsp;.  who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".  In the United States "freethought was a basically anti-christian {{ Anti-Christianity }} , anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters.  A number of contributors to Liberty (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.  The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker.  E. C.  Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer".  "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty.  nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".  In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established "modern" or progressive schools {{ Progressive education }} in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.  The schools stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".  Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.  Murray Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence.  Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrers Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally. " La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrers ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of Modern Schools {{ Modern School (United States) }} in the United States, Cuba, South America and London.  The first of these was started in New York City in 1911.  It also inspired the Italian newspaper Università popolare {{ Università popolare (Italian newspaper) }} , founded in 1901.  Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.  Tolstoys educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.  Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.  He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself nbsp;.  Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.  [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".  For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".  A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school {{ anarchist free school }} in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches.  Experiments in Germany led to A.  S.  Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921.  Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.  However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.  In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.  The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Mutualism
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.  Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order. " Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.  For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service. Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity {{ Reciprocity (cultural anthropology) }} , free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.  According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount. " Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.  Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property. "
Individualist anarchism
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will {{ will (philosophy) }} over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.  Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. In 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote Political Justice, which some consider the first expression of anarchism.  Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state {{ Limited government }} as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.  Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.   ). ]]An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner.  Stirners The Ego and Its Own, published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.  According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality.  To Stirner, rights were spooks {{ Reification (fallacy) }} in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality".  Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists {{ union of egoists }} , non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.  Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.  "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirners philosophy.  It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist John Henry Mackay. Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published.  For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent nbsp;.  that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews nbsp;.  William B.  Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form. ".  Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.  Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic {{ Development criticism }} , surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.  He is best known for his books Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience {{ Civil Disobedience (Thoreau) }} , an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.  Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirners egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty {{ Liberty (1881–1908) }} . From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists {{ Naturism }} nudists {{ Nudism }} (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clerical {{ Anti-clericalism }} activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France).  These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde, Emile Armand, Han Ryner, Henri Zisly, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others.
Social anarchism
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion.  It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.  Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid {{ mutual aid (organization) }} .
Syncretic anarchism
The term syncretic anarchism was first coined by Alberto Frigo in relation to his reading of Jacques Ellul.  Rephrasing the latter, Frigo observed that, if on one hand new technologies creates new form of power, on the other, new technologies are accompanied by the rise of what Marcel Mauss defines as magic.  By developing the techniques to perform new magic and by adhering to it, marginal individuals come to create forms of syncretism which brings together the different dogmas and cultures a power structures uses to put humans against one another.  The 19th century French postman Ferdinand Cheval for example, has intuitively experimented with the, at that time, new medium of cement, and created, after 33 years of adherence to certain rituals, a monument blending religions from around the world.
Collectivist anarchism
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most.  Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.  This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.  However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.  This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".  Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.  Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, market {{ market (economics) }} s, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".   Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom.  Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.  Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.  The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.  To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i. e. , established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution {{ Spanish Revolution of 1936 }} and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution {{ Russian Revolution (1917) }} .  Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war {{ Francoism }} , Hitler {{ Adolf Hitler }} , Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.  During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.  Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.  The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers solidarity {{ wikt:Solidarity }} , Direct action and Workers self-managementAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.  Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing.  They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.  Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.  He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet Anarcho-Syndicalism.  The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.  The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement.  It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their childs life.  These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress {{ Regressive autism }} .  The diagnostic criteria {{ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders }} require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.   Autism is due to a combination of genetic {{ Heritability of autism }} and environmental factors.  Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol {{ ethanol }} or cocaine.  Controversies {{ Controversies in autism }} surround other proposed environmental causes {{ Causes of autism }} ; for example, the vaccine hypotheses {{ MMR vaccine controversy }} , which have since been disproven.  Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.  In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified {{ PDD-NOS }} (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.   Early speech or behavioral interventions {{ Early intensive behavioral intervention }} can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.  Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered.  Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.  An autistic culture {{ Sociological and cultural aspects of autism }} has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder {{ Autism rights movement }} .   Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21. 7 million people as of 2013.  As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide.  It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls.  About 1. 5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012.  The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1. 1%.  The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.
Characteristics
Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission {{ Remission (medicine) }} .  People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others.  Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years, and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.  It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior.  Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.  Autisms individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.
Causes
It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms.  However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.   Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism {{ Heritability of autism }} are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.  Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression.  Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.  Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0. 7 for autism and as high as 0. 9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population.  However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified.  Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD.  Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.  Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism.  The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation nbsp;— such as deletions {{ Deletion (genetics) }} , duplications {{ Gene duplication }} or inversions {{ Chromosomal inversion }} in genetic material during meiosis.  Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.  Several lines of evidence point to synaptic {{ Synapse }} dysfunction as a cause of autism.  Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion.  Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes.  All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception {{ Human fertilization }} , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.  Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially heavy metals {{ heavy metal (chemistry) }} and particulates, may increase the risk of autism.  Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, diesel exhaust, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol {{ Ethanol }} , smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress.  No evidence has been found for these claims, and some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.  Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination.  This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine "overload" {{ Vaccine controversy#Vaccine overload }} , a vaccine preservative {{ Thiomersal controversy }} , or the MMR vaccine {{ MMR vaccine controversy }} for causing autism.  The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud".  Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases {{ MMR vaccine controversy#Disease outbreaks }} in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.
Mechanism
Autisms symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.  How autism occurs is not well understood.  Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors.  The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis {{ Medical diagnosis }} is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism.  Under the DSM-5, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.  These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment.  Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language {{ Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry and psychology }} , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects.  The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay.  ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.  Several diagnostic instruments are available.  Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child.  The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.  The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.  A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.  If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions.  A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.  A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome.  The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression {{ Major depressive disorder }} .  Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.  Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing.  A genotype-first {{ Genotype-first approach }} model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genomes copy number variations.  As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.  Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autisms genetics.  Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.  ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.  In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.  Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices.  The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms.  Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.  It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms.
Screening
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their childs unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.  According to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations.  Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".   No babbling by 12 months.  No gesturing {{ Gesture }} (pointing, waving, etc. ) by 12 months.  No single words by 16 months.  No two-word (spontaneous, not just echolalic {{ echolalia }} ) phrases by 24 months.  Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns.  The Japanese practice is to screen {{ Screening (medicine) }} all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests.  In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened.  It is not known which approach is more effective.  Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT {{ Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers }} and its predecessor, the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity {{ Sensitivity (tests) }} (many false-negatives) but good specificity {{ Specificity (tests) }} (few false-positives).  It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.  Screening tools designed for one cultures norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.  Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features.
Prevention
Infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism; vaccination against rubella {{ rubella vaccine }} can prevent many of those cases.
Management
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence.  In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes.  No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the childs needs.  Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.  Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy, however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years.  Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.  Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.  Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching {{ TEACCH }} , speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.  Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit.  There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40 nbsp;hours a week for multiple years, is an effective treatment for some children with ASD.  Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP).  One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves.  Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation.  Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.
Society and culture
The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism.  Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease.  Proponents of this movement wish to seek "acceptance, not cures. " There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as World Autism Awareness Day, Light It Up Blue, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others.  There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someones life.  These organizations include Autism Speaks, Autism National Committee, Autism Society of America, and many others.  Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about "autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons.  and research on social movements. " Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism.  Rain Man, a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities.  While many autistics dont have these special abilities, there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.  Some autistic people prefer the rainbow symbol over the puzzle-piece based ones.
Prognosis
There is no known cure.  Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not.  It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%.  Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years.  Most children with autism lack social support, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or self-determination {{ Self-determination theory }} .  Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.  Few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis.  Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife.  Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism.  Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood.
Epidemiology
Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASDs true rate.  Globally, autism affects an estimated 21. 7 million people as of 2013, while Asperger syndrome affects a further 31. 1 million.  In 2012, the NHS {{ National Health Service }} estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1. 1%.  Rates of PDD-NOSs has been estimated at 3. 7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0. 6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0. 02 per 1,000.  CDCs most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children, or 14. 7 per 1,000, has an ASD as of 2010.  The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.  This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.  The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autisms true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.  Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls.  The sex ratio averages 4. 3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5. 5:1 without.  Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.  Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.  The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.  Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.  Several other conditions are common in children with autism.  They include: Genetic disorders.  About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.   Intellectual disability.  The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.  In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker, and by definition, the diagnosis of Aspergers excludes intellectual disability.   Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%.  Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASDs symptoms.   Epilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.   Several metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.   Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population.   Preempted diagnoses.  Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) {{ Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder }} , Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses {{ Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders }} are increasingly accepted.   Sleep problems affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood.  These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings {{ middle-of-the-night insomnia }} , and early morning awakenings.  Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.
History
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named.  The Table Talk {{ Table Talk (Luther) }} of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.  Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.  The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blairs marriage to gain Blairs inheritance.  The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard {{ Jean Marc Gaspard Itard }} treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.  The New Latin word autismus (English translation autism) was coined by the Swiss {{ Swiss people }} psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia.  He derived it from the Greek word autós (α?τός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".  The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital {{ Vienna General Hospital }} adopted Bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology.  Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.  Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.  Almost all the characteristics described in Kanners first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.  It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.  Donald Triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism.  He was diagnosed by Leo Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1".  Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and mentally multiplying numbers.  His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U. S.  president pictures.  By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism.  He was also interested in creating musical chords.  Kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia, and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to "refrigerator mothers".  Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.  As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.  Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their childs autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.  It took until 1980 for the DSM-III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia.  In 1987, the DSM-III-R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism.  In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders.  The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, Autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and CDD {{ Childhood disintegrative disorder }} , has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.  The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.  Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being {{ Neurodiversity }} .
Social development
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification {{ #Classification }} ) from other developmental disorders.  People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted.  Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".  Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.  Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name.  Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.  Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others.  However, they do form attachments {{ Attachment (psychology) }} to their primary caregivers.  Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security {{ Attachment in children#Secure attachment }} than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.  Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition {{ Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism }} although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a persons own emotions.  Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone.  Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism.  For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel.  Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.  There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD.  The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums.
Communication
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.  Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver.  In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words.  Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns {{ Pronoun reversal }} .  Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.  Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.  In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling.  Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference.  As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.
Repetitive behavior
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.   Stereotyped behaviors {{ Stereotypy }} : Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.  Compulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.  Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.  Ritualistic behavior {{ Ritual#Psychology }} : Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual.  This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.   Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.  Self-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking {{ Dermatillomania }} , hand-biting and head-banging.  No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.
Other symptoms
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.  An estimated 0. 5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants {{ Savant syndrome }} .  Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.  Sensory {{ Sensory system }} abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.  Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).  An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone {{ Hypotonia }} , poor motor planning {{ Apraxia }} , and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.  Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.  Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition.  Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.  Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress {{ stress (psychological) }} .  Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship.  However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
Pathophysiology
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as Parkinsons, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.  Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.  Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.  This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.  Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood.  It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism.  It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization.  Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following: An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions.   Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation.   Unbalanced excitatory–inhibitory networks.   Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines, for example, by modulation of the neurexin–neuroligin cell-adhesion {{ Cell adhesion }} system, or by poorly regulated synthesis {{ Protein synthesis }} of synaptic proteins.  Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy, which may explain why the two conditions are associated.  The immune system is thought to play an important role in autism.  Children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia.  Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication.  Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage {{ Human embryogenesis }} of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.  It is thought that activation of a pregnant mothers immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development.  This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.  The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport.  The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway.  Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors.  Also, some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.  The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autisms core features of social impairment and communication difficulties.  The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action.  The MNS may contribute to an individuals understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.  Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.  However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.   ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.  In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the task-positive network, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking .  In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought.  The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.  Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave {{ Electroencephalography }} study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex {{ Cerebral cortex }} and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex.  Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere {{ Cerebral hemisphere }} of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex {{ Association areas }} .  From studies based on event-related potentials, transient changes to the brains electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.  For example, magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brains processing of auditory signals.  In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21. 1 deletion syndrome.  Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13. 3), chromosome 16 (16p13. 1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.  Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism.  Hypo-connectivity seems to dominate, especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity.
Neuropsychology
Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior. The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition.  Simon Baron-Cohens empathizing–systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.  An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.  These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohens earlier theory of mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others.  The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally–Anne test for reasoning about others motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology {{ #Pathophysiology }} maps well to the hypothesis.  However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other peoples basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints.  The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the executive functions such as working memory, planning, inhibition {{ Inhibition Theory }} .  In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism".  Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.  A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.  Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism.  One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.  A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.  These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism. Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.  A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.
Classification
Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.  These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.  Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.  Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development.  The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or sometimes the autistic disorders, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism.  In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably.  ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits {{ Trait (biology) }} , such as avoiding eye contact.  The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum {{ Spectrum disorder }} , ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.  Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.  Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.  Autism can also be divided into syndromal {{ Syndrome }} and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis.  Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism {{ Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome#Differences from high-functioning autism }} is unclear.  Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age.  The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.  Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics.  Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.  It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
Education
Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: intensive ABA treatment {{ Early intensive behavioral intervention }} has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children.  Similarly, teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well-established treatment in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms.  Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.  It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.  The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
Medication
Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails.  More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics.  Antipsychotics, such as risperidone and aripiprazole, have been found to be useful for treating irritability, repetitive behavior, and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism, however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically.  There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.  No known medication relieves autisms core symptoms of social and communication impairments.  Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
Alternative medicine
Although many alternative therapies and interventions {{ Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities }} are available, few are supported by scientific studies.  Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life {{ Quality of life }} contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance.  Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests.  Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk.  A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets; in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism.  There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatment {{ Hyperbaric medicine }} s in children with autism.  Although popularly used as an alternative treatment {{ complementary and alternative medicine }} for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit.  In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity {{ non-celiac gluten sensitivity }} there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.
Cost
Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so.  For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ }} (net present value in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.  Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment.  US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance.  After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and estate planning.

<TEXT>Intro
Albedo ( ) is a measure for reflectance or optical brightness (Latin albedo, "whiteness").  It is dimensionless {{ Dimensionless number }} and measured on a scale from zero (corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation) to one (corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation). Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiation reflected to the radiation incident on a surface.  The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earths surface.  These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see Position of the Sun).  While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i. e. , for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period.  The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, seasonal or annual averages. Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation {{ Sunlight }} .  Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (approximately between 0. 3 and 3 μm).  This spectrum includes visible light {{ Visible spectrum }} (0. 39-0. 7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e. g. , trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e. g. , snow reflects most radiation). Albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e. g. , as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings).  The average albedo of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere, its planetary albedo, is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.  The term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work Photometria.
Terrestrial albedo
Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0. 9 for fresh snow to about 0. 04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances.  Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body.  When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms.  Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0. 1 to 0. 4.  The average albedo of Earth is about 0. 3.  This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.  Earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASAs MODIS instruments on board the Terra {{ Terra (satellite) }} and Aqua {{ Aqua (satellite) }} satellites.  As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e. g. , ).  These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) {{ Bidirectional reflectance distribution function }} , which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle.  Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo. Earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 nbsp;°C.  If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 nbsp;°C.  If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 nbsp;°C.  In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 nbsp;°C.
Astronomical albedo
The albedos of planets, satellites {{ Natural satellite }} and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties.  The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry {{ photometry (astronomy) }} .  For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos.  For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids. Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.  Another notable high-albedo body is Eris {{ Eris (dwarf planet) }} , with an albedo of 0. 96.  Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0. 05.  A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0. 04.  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered {{ space weathering }} surface containing some organic compounds. The overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0. 136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.  Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies. Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected).  Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion. In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle {{ phase angle (astronomy) }} , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces. The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude {{ Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H) }} and diameter is:  A =\left ( \frac } \right ) ^2 ,where A is the astronomical albedo, D is the diameter in kilometers, and H is the absolute magnitude.
Other types of albedo
Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles.  It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.
White-sky and black-sky albedo
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θ i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, \bar , with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and being the proportion of diffuse illumination. Hence, the actual albedo (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:: = (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar .  Directional-hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo.  These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
Illumination
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater.  The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.  The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.
Insolation effects
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation.  Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.
Climate and weather
Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs.  The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.
Albedo–temperature feedback
When an areas albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results.  A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling.  In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e. g. , a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback.  However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting.  When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.
Snow
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0. 9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0. 4 for melting snow, and as low as 0. 2 for dirty snow.  Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0. 8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).  Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.  Hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.
Small-scale effects
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too.  In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.
Solar photovoltaic effects
Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic device {{ photovoltaic system }} s.  For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions.  Research showed impacts of over 10%.  More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.
Trees
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation).  In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.  Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration.  The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.  Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0. 15 to 0. 18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0. 09 to 0. 15.  Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests.  They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e. g. , Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.
Water
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials.  The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).  At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner {{ specular reflection }} (not diffusely {{ Diffuse reflection }} ).  The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this.  At small angles of incident {{ angle of incidence (optics) }} light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs. -incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.  Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator {{ terminator (solar) }} (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles).  However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction.  Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities.  Fresh black ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Clouds
Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.  Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0. 8.  "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.  Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth. " Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic.  A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
Aerosol effects
Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earths radiative balance.  The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.  As per the effects are:   Aerosol direct effect.  Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation.  The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.  Aerosol indirect effect.  Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei.  Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (first indirect effect), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect).
Black carbon
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles.  The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0. 2 W m −2 , with a range +0. 1 to +0. 4 W m −2 .  Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.
Human activities
Human activities (e. g. , deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe.  However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

<TEXT>Intro
A (named {{ English alphabet#Letter names }} , plural As, As, as, as or aes ) is the first letter {{ Letter (alphabet) }} and the first vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter {{ Greek_alphabet#History }} alpha, from which it derives.  The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar.  The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ.  The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.
History
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet).  In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. In 1600 B. C. E. , the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms.  Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Hebrew {{ Hebrew alphabet }} or Arabic {{ Arabic script }} aleph.  When the ancient Greeks {{ Ancient Greece }} adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician {{ Phoenician language }} and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha.  In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. The Etruscans {{ Etruscan civilization }} brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged.  The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet {{ Old Italic script }} to write the Latin language {{ Latin }} , and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet {{ Latin script }} that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.
Other uses
In algebra, the letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities. In geometry, capital A, B, C etc.  are used to denote segment {{ Line segment }} s, line {{ line (geometry) }} s, rays {{ Line (geometry)#Ray }} , etc.  A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.  "A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, etc.  Such associations can have a motivating {{ motivation }} effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.  Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.
Typographic variants
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A".  First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums.  There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces.  Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule {{ letter case }} cursive, minuscule {{ letter case }} cursive, and semicursive minuscule.  Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles.  The known variants include the early semi-uncial {{ Uncial script#Half-uncial }} , the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.   At the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe.  Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular {{ Insular script }} or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain.  By the 9th century, the Caroline script {{ Carolingian minuscule }} , which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press.  This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.  15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today.  These variants, the Italic and Roman forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version.  The Italic form, also called script a, is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke.  This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.  The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").  Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form.  In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown.  Many fonts then made the right leg vertical.  In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type).  There are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ("ɑ"), also called Latin alpha, is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet).
English
In modern English orthography, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds: the near-open front unrounded vowel as in pad; the open back unrounded vowel as in father, which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;  the diphthong as in ace and major (usually when is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from Middle English lengthening followed by the Great Vowel Shift; the modified form of the above sound that occurs before {{ English-language vowel changes before historic /r/ }} , as in square and Mary; the rounded vowel of water; the shorter rounded vowel (not present in General American) in was and what;  a schwa, in many unstressed syllables, as in about, comma, solar. The double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as Aaron and aardvark.  However, occurs in many common digraphs {{ List of Latin-script digraphs }} , all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .  is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after and ), and the second most common in Spanish and French.  In one study, on average, about 3. 68% of letters used in English texts tend to be , while the number is 6. 22% in Spanish and 3. 95% in French.
Other languages

<TEXT>Intro
Alabama ( ) is a state {{ U. S.  state }} in the southeastern region {{ Southern United States }} of the United States.  It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia {{ Georgia (U. S.  state) }} to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.  Alabama is the 30th-most extensive {{ List of U. S.  states and territories by area }} and the 24th-most populous {{ List of U. S.  states and territories by population }} of the U. S.  states {{ List of U. S.  states }} .  At nearly , Alabama has one of the nations longest navigable inland waterways.  Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer {{ northern flicker }} State, after the state bird {{ List of U. S.  state birds }} .  Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the Cotton State.  The state tree {{ List of U. S.  state trees }} is the longleaf pine, and the state flower {{ List of U. S.  state flowers }} is the camellia.  Alabamas capital is Montgomery {{ Montgomery, Alabama }} .  The largest city by population is Birmingham {{ Birmingham, Alabama }} , which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is Huntsville {{ Huntsville, Alabama }} .  The oldest city is Mobile {{ Mobile, Alabama }} , founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.  From the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many states in the southern U. S.  {{ Southern United States }} , suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture.  Like other southern states, Alabama legislators disenfranchised African Americans {{ Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era }} and many poor whites at the turn of the century.  Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white {{ White American }} rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s; urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented.  Following World War II, Alabama grew as the states economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.  The state economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.
Etymology
The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe {{ Muskogean languages }} whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa {{ Coosa River }} and Tallapoosa {{ Tallapoosa River }} rivers on the upper reaches of the river.  In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).  The word Alabama is believed to have come from the Alabama language, and a suggestion the name was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely.  The words spelling varies significantly among historical sources.  The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega {{ Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler) }} used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.  As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons.  Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, Allibamou.  Sources disagree on the words meaning.  Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and amo (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather").  The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants.  The state has numerous place names of Native American origin {{ List of place names in Alabama of Native American origin }} .  However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language. An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant "Here We Rest. " This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.  Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.
Geography
Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3. 2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U. S.  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.  The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.  Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia {{ Georgia (U. S.  state) }} to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west.  Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.  The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to over 1,800 nbsp;feet (550 nbsp;m) in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast. The highest point is Mount Cheaha, at a height of .  Alabamas land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area.  Suburban Baldwin County {{ Baldwin County, Alabama }} , along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.  Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City {{ Alexander City, Alabama }} ; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne {{ Fort Payne, Alabama }} ; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport {{ Bridgeport, Alabama }} ; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee {{ Tuskegee, Alabama }} ; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.  Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests {{ United States National Forest }} : Conecuh {{ Conecuh National Forest }} , Talladega {{ Talladega National Forest }} , Tuskegee {{ Tuskegee National Forest }} , and William B.  Bankhead {{ William B.  Bankhead National Forest }} .  Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail {{ Trail of Tears }} .  A notable natural wonder in Alabama is "Natural Bridge" {{ Natural Bridge, Alabama }} rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies {{ Rocky Mountains }} , located just south of Haleyville {{ Haleyville, Alabama }} . A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County {{ Elmore County, Alabama }} , just north of Montgomery.  This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of "Alabamas greatest natural disaster. " A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 nbsp;million years ago.  The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.  In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.
Demographics
The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,858,979 on July 1, 2015, which represents an increase of 79,243, or 1. 66%, since the 2010 Census {{ 2010 United States Census }} .  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.  Immigration {{ Immigration to the United States }} from outside the U. S.  resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.  The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2. 4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22. 2% were undocumented (24,000). The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County {{ Chilton County, Alabama }} , outside the town of Jemison {{ Jemison, Alabama }} .
Economy
The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication {{ fabrication (metal) }} .  By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1. 5 billion.  In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the states gross domestic product.  The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.  Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.  According to the U. S.  Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170 nbsp;billion, or $29,411 per capita.  Alabamas 2012 GDP increased 1. 2% from the previous year.  The single largest increase came in the area of information.  In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.  The states seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5. 8% in April 2015.  This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5. 4%.  Alabama has no state minimum wage and uses the federal minimum wage of $7. 25.  In February 2016, the state passed legislation that prevents Alabama municipalities from raising the minimum wage in their locality.  The legislation voids a Birmingham city ordinance that was to raise the citys minimum wage to $10. 10.

Pre-European settlement
Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization.  Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 nbsp;BC–AD nbsp;700) and continued until European contact {{ European colonization of the Americas }} .  The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.  This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture.  Analysis of artifacts {{ Artifact (archaeology) }} from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).  Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently.  The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.  Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama {{ Alabama (people) }} (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek {{ Creek people }} , and Koasati.  While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.
European settlement
With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama.  The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540.  More than 160 years later, the French founded the regions first European settlement at Old Mobile {{ Old Mobile Site }} in 1702.  The city was moved to the current site of Mobile {{ Mobile, Alabama }} in 1711.  This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.  After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783.  After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain.  The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U. S.  forces on April 13, 1813.  Thomas Bassett, a loyalist {{ Loyalist (American Revolution) }} to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile.  He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s.  The districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County {{ Clarke County, Alabama }} , northernmost Mobile County {{ Mobile County, Alabama }} , and most of Washington County {{ Washington County, Alabama }} .  What is now the counties of Baldwin {{ Baldwin County, Alabama }} and Mobile {{ Mobile County, Alabama }} became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812.  Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period.  It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards.  Following the Revolutionary War {{ American Revolution }} , it remained a part of Georgia {{ Georgia (U. S.  state) }} , although heavily disputed.   With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798.  The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.  Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.
19th century
Before Mississippis {{ Mississippi }} admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory.  The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817.  St.  Stephens {{ St.  Stephens, Alabama }} , now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.  Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819 with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention.  From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution.  Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba {{ Cahaba, Alabama }} in Dallas County {{ Dallas County, Alabama }} .   Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.  Alabama Fever was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.  Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves {{ History of slavery in Alabama }} with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama {{ List of plantations in Alabama }} expanded.  The economy of the central Black Belt {{ Black Belt (region of Alabama) }} (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations {{ Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States }} whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor.  The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers.  Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.  Most Native American tribes were completely removed {{ Indian removal }} from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.   From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa {{ Tuscaloosa, Alabama }} served as Alabamas capital.  On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery {{ Montgomery, Alabama }} .  The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.  A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia.  The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851.  This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day.  It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.  By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color.  On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession {{ Secession in the United States }} from the Union {{ Union (American Civil War) }} .  After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America.  The Confederacys capital was initially at Montgomery {{ Montgomery, Alabama }} .  Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War {{ Alabama in the American Civil War }} .  Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.  A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrests battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails.  This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.  Alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.  Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868.  From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state.  Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S.  Turner, and James T.  Rapier.  Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  During Reconstruction {{ Reconstruction era of the United States }} , state legislators ratified a new state constitution {{ Constitution of Alabama }} in 1868 that created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights.  Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.  Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.  Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts {{ Red Shirts (Southern United States) }} , and the White League.  Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence.  They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.  The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated {{ racial segregation }} schools.  Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.  After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.
20th century
The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised {{ Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era }} large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax {{ Poll tax (United States) }} and literacy test.  The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools.  By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate.  This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900.  The numbers dropped even more in later decades.  The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.  While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.  By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs.  520,000 African-Americans.  Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote.  Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement.  The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens. The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.  Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools.  In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs.  The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest.  Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas.  They often donated land and labor as well.   Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children.  A total of 387 schools, seven teachers houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state.  Several of the surviving school buildings {{ The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings Multiple Property Submission }} in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration {{ Great Migration (African American) }} out of the South.  Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "historical populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920. At the same time, many rural people, both white and African American, migrated to the city of Birmingham {{ Birmingham, Alabama }} to work in new industrial jobs.  Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the "Magic City".  By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the states population.  Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.  Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution.  This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.  Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter -steps designed to disfranchise black voters.  The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants.  Black citizens in Mobile {{ Mobile, Alabama }} successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment {{ Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution }} .  The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee {{ Tuskegee, Alabama }} to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits.  The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial "gerrymandering" violated the Constitution.  In 1961, .  the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.  Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.  Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.  One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.  Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.  Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses.  They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.  In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham. One result was that Jefferson County {{ Jefferson County, Alabama }} , containing Birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.  A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature. " A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in Lowndes County, Alabama challenged the state legislatures lack of redistricting for congressional seats.  In 1962 White v.  Crook, Judge Frank M.  Johnson ordered the state to redistrict.  United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v.  Carr (1962) and Reynolds v.  Sims (1964) ruled that the principle of "one man, one vote" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.  Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts. African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the Civil Rights Movement, including legal challenges.  In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v.  Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply.  During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.  The Civil Rights Movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.  These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U. S.  Congress. Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.  Despite recommendations of a 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission, the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties.  There is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies.  This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.  Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.  In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v.  Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards.  At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats.  Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions. As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cites and counties, including Chilton County {{ Chilton County, Alabama }} , adopted a system of cumulative voting {{ proportional representation }} for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions.  This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters.  In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County {{ Conecuh County, Alabama }} .  In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County {{ Conecuh County, Alabama }} .  Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.
Climate
The state is classified as humid subtropical {{ humid subtropical climate }} (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification {{ Humid temperate climate }} .  The average annual temperature is 64 nbsp;°F (18 nbsp;°C).  Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year.  Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.  Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U. S. , with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state.  Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes.  Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. South Alabama reports many thunderstorms.  The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported.  This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 nbsp;days per year.  Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm.  Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.   Alabama, along with Oklahoma, has the most reported EF5 tornadoes {{ Enhanced Fujita scale }} of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.  Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state.  The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak.  The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state.  The tally reached 62.   The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state.  Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season.  The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U. S.  most vulnerable to violent tornadoes.  The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains. Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U. S. , with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham.  Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include New Years Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century.  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall. Alabamas highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville {{ Centerville, Alabama }} .  The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market {{ New Market, Alabama }} .
Flora and fauna
Alabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont {{ Piedmont (United States) }} , Canebrake {{ Canebrake (region of Alabama) }} and Black Belt {{ Black Belt (region of Alabama) }} of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south.  The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.  Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state.  It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora.  It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.  Indigenous {{ Indigenous (ecology) }} animal species in the state include 62 mammal species, 93 reptile species, 73 amphibian species, roughly 307 native freshwater fish species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state.  Invertebrates include 83 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species.  113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.
Race and ancestry
According to the 2010 Census {{ 2010 United States Census }} , Alabama had a population of 4,779,736.  The racial composition of the state was 68. 5% White {{ White American }} (67. 0% Non-Hispanic White and 1. 5% Hispanic White), 26. 2% Black or African American {{ African American }} , 3. 9% Hispanic or Latino {{ Hispanic and Latino Americans }} of any race, 1. 1% Asian, 0. 6% American Indian and Alaska Native {{ Native Americans in the United States }} , 0. 1% Native Hawaiian {{ Native Hawaiians }} and Other Pacific Islander, 2. 0% from Some Other Race, and 1. 5% from Two or More Races.  In 2011, 46. 6% of Alabamas population younger than age 1 were minorities.  The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African {{ African American }} (26. 2%), English {{ English American }} (23. 6%), Irish {{ Irish American }} (7. 7%), German {{ German Americans }} (5. 7%), and Scots-Irish {{ Scots-Irish American }} (2. 0%).  Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many Anglo-Americans {{ English American }} identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s.  Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher.  In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.   Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.  Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization.  The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.  In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission.  Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination.  Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected.  In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized {{ State recognized tribes in the United States }} nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast.  These are:  Poarch Band of Creek Indians (who also have federal recognition), MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, Star Clan of Muscogee Creeks {{ Muscogee Creek people }} , Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, Cherokee Tribe of Northeast Alabama, Cher-O-Creek Intra Tribal Indians, Ma-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe, Piqua Shawnee Tribe, and Ani-Yun-Wiya Nation. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.

Language
95. 1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96. 1% in 2000.  Alabama English is predominantly Southern {{ Southern American English }} , and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee.  In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of bird.  In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland arm and barb rhyming with form and orb.  Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).

Marshall Space Flight Center and the U. S.  Army Materiel Command {{ United States Army Materiel Command }} , headquartered at Redstone Arsenal.  A great deal of Alabamas economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the states expanding automotive manufacturing industry.  Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U. S.  International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers.  Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state.  Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.  Automakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012.  The eight models produced at the states auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012.  The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.   Steel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U. S.  Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people.  In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert {{ Calvert, Alabama }} in Mobile County {{ Mobile County, Alabama }} for a 4. 65 billion combined stainless {{ stainless steel }} and carbon steel processing facility.  ThyssenKrupps stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012.  The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1. 6 billion in March 2013.  Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3. 8 billion.  In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.  The Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. , is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there.

State government
The foundational document for Alabamas government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901.  At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the worlds longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.  There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabamas constitution.  Critics argue that Alabamas constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands.  Most counties do not have home rule.  Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum.  One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.  Alabamas government is divided into three coequal branches.  The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members.  The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.  The Republican Party {{ Republican Party (United States) }} currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature {{ Alabama Legislature }} .  The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto). Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county.  It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented.  It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either.  In Reynolds v.  Sims (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of "one man, one vote", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented. ) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.  At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts.  This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas.  For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding.  Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments. The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws.  It is headed by the Governor of Alabama.  Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama.  The current governor {{ Governor of Alabama }} of the state is Republican {{ Republican Party (United States) }} Kay Ivey.  The office of lieutenant governor {{ List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama }} is currently vacant. The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections.  Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.  The judicial branch {{ Judiciary }} is responsible for interpreting the Constitution {{ Alabama Constitution }} and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases.  The states highest court {{ State supreme court }} is the Supreme Court of Alabama.  Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.  Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.  The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Roy Moore.  All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.  There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.  Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions.  Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate {{ Capital punishment in Alabama }} in the country.  In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger.  Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases.  It is the only state that still allows judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries.
Taxes
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax {{ State income tax }} , depending upon the amount earned and filing status.  Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax {{ Income tax in the United States }} from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction.  Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (Social Security and Medicare tax). The states general sales tax rate is 4%.  Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.  For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal.  , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide.  Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families.  (Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate. ) Alabamas income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States.  Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.  Alabamas threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.  The corporate income tax rate is currently 6. 5%.  The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.  Property taxes are the lowest in the U. S.  The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. Since Alabamas tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure.  For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 nbsp;million.
County and local governments
Alabama has 67 counties {{ county (United States) }} .  Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission.  It also has limited executive authority in the county.  Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule.  Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.  The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators being buried in local county issues. The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.  Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county.  United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v.  Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote".  Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties.  The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas. "The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution.  Alabamas constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city.  A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance. " Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol.  The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.  Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "dry counties {{ Dry county }} " which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.
Politics
During Reconstruction {{ Reconstruction era of the United States }} following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope {{ John Pope (military officer) }} .  In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate {{ racial segregation }} and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution.  Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites.  By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000.  The total effects were greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law. From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas.  As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform.  Governor George Wallace, the states only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation.  Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights.  In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections.  Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards. In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact.  In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.
Primary and secondary education
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education.  Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.  Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund.  In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education.  That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.  In 2007, over 82 nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. While Alabamas public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states.  According to U. S.  Census data, Alabamas high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U. S.  (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.  Although unusual in the West, school corporal punishment is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled {{ paddle (spanking) }} at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.  The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.

Christianity
Alabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians.  Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.  A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant.  , the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational {{ Nondenominational Christianity }} Evangelical Protestant.  In Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents.  Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South.  The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members.  The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA {{ Presbyterian Church in America }} – 28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA) – 26,247 members in 147 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church – 6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America – 5,000 members and 50 congregations plus the EPC {{ Edgewater Presbyterian Church }} and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).  In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels {{ Canonical Gospels }} .  Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning.  In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.
Other faiths
Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Baháí Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.  Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London.  The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Shaarai Shomayim {{ Congregation Shaarai Shomayim (Mobile, Alabama) }} in Mobile.  It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844.  Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe.  Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox {{ Orthodox Judaism }} , four Conservative {{ Conservative Judaism }} , ten Reform {{ Reform Judaism }} , and one Humanistic {{ Humanistic Judaism }} synagogue.  Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.  Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian {{ Indian people }} immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham {{ Birmingham, Alabama }} , the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham {{ Pelham, Alabama }} , the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw {{ Capshaw, Alabama }} , and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa {{ Tuscaloosa, Alabama }} .  There are six Dharma centers {{ Dharma centre }} and organizations for Theravada Buddhists.  Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre {{ Bayou La Batre, Alabama }} .  This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam {{ Indochina refugee crisis }} during the 1970s and thereafter.  The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.  The first community of adherents of the Bahai Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K.  Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope.  Bahai Centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Alabama, Huntsville, Alabama, and Florence, Alabama.
State elections
With the disfranchisement of African Americans {{ Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era }} in 1901, the state became part of the "Solid South", a system in which the Democratic Party {{ Democratic Party (United States) }} operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state.  For nearly 100 nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary {{ primary election }} , with generally only token Republican {{ Republican Party (United States) }} challengers running in the General Election.  Since the mid to late-20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party.  In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office. Members of the nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office.  Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats.  In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, Ernest C.  Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O.  Hooper, Sr.  Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.  This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles.  The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench. In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive {{ Political party strength in Alabama }} branch offices.  Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education.  In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.  The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.  Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise.  The two GOP Lt.  Governors were Steve Windom (1999–2003) and the current Lt.  Governor, Kay Ivey, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.
Local elections
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc. ) in the state are still held by Democrats.  Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary.  Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.  Alabamas 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts.  The current split is 35 Democrats {{ Alabama Democratic Party }} , 31 Republicans {{ Alabama Republican Party }} , and one Independent Fayette.  However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties.  The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.  , the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in Morgan County, Alabama, and ten African-American sheriffs.
Federal elections
The states two U. S.  senators {{ United States Senate }} are Luther Strange and Richard C.  Shelby {{ Richard Shelby }} , both Republicans.  Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election. In the U. S.  House of Representatives {{ United States House of Representatives }} , the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bradley Byrne, Mike D.  Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Morris J.  Brooks, Martha Roby, and Gary Palmer {{ Gary Palmer (politician) }} ) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell who represents the Black Belt {{ Black Belt (region of Alabama) }} as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham {{ Birmingham, Alabama }} , Tuscaloosa {{ Tuscaloosa, Alabama }} and Montgomery {{ Montgomery, Alabama }} .

<TEXT>Intro
In Greek mythology, Achilles ( , ; ) was a Greek {{ Greeks }} hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homers Iliad.  His mother was the immortal nymph Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy.  Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris {{ Paris (mythology) }} , who shot him in the heel with an arrow.  Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel.  Alluding to these legends, the term "Achilles heel" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with a strong constitution.
Etymology
Achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of ( ) "grief" and ( ) "a people, tribe, nation. " In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles).  Achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ("glory", usually glory in war). Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster {{ muster (military) }} .  With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war.  The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership. R.  S.  P.  Beekes {{ Robert S.  P.  Beekes }} has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.  The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG {{ Inscriptiones Graecae }} II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus {{ Female gladiator#Halicarnassus }} as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".
Birth
Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons.  Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.  For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.  There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv. 760) Zeus sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.  Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.   According to the Achilleid, written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river Styx.  However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel (see Achilles heel, Achilles tendon).  It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier.  In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body.  She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.  However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.  To the contrary, in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander.  He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood". Also, in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the heros death, Cypria (unknown author), Aithiopis by Arctinus of Miletus, Little Iliad by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou persis by Arctinus of Miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, on Mt.  Pelion, to be reared.
Achilles in the Trojan War
The first two lines of the Iliad read:: : :Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus son Achilles,:the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans {{ Achaeans (Homer) }} . Achilles consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. Thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity.  Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war.  According to the Iliad, Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons (Book 2).  He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).
Achilles and Patroclus
The exact nature of Achilles relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the Iliad, it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship.  Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers.  Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors.  Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures.  In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia {{ Pederasty in ancient Greece }} .  In Platos Symposium, the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.  But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.
Worship of Achilles in antiquity
There was an archaic heroic cult of Achilles on the White Island, Leuce {{ Snake Island (Black Sea) }} , in the Black Sea off the modern coasts of Romania and Ukraine, with a temple and an oracle which survived into the Roman period.  In the lost epic Aithiopis, a continuation of the Iliad attributed to Arktinus of Miletos {{ Arctinus }} , Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube.  There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games. Plinys {{ Pliny the Elder }} Natural History {{ Natural History (Pliny) }} mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from Peuce by the Danube Delta, and the temple there.  Pausanias {{ Pausanias (geographer) }} has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame.  In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue".  Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island. Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister.  The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called Leuce "because the wild animals which live there are white.  It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor".  The Periplus of the Euxine Sea {{ Periplus Ponti Euxini }} gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there.  Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work.  This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles.  In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude.  One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated.  Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time.  There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple.  Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it.  And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings.  Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally.  They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed.  Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor.  But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms.  As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle.  They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair.  But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient.  And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught.  So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims.  To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships".  (quoted in Densuşianu)The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the Pontic Sea {{ Black Sea }} but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea. Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as Pontarches the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation.  Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice.  To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (Stephanus Byzantinus), Achilleios in Laconia (Pausanias {{ Pausanias (geographer) }} , III. 25,4) Nicolae Densuşianu (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law. " Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing.  Pausanias (III. 19,13) reports that the Delphic Pythia {{ Delphi }} sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  Ammianus Marcellinus (XXII. 8) attributes the healing to waters (aquae) on the island.
Other stories
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros.  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes daughter Deidamia {{ Deidamia (mythology) }} , whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his fathers possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.  In book 11 of Homers Odyssey, Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades.  One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead.  But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his sons exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.  This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.  Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes. The kings of the Epirus {{ Despotate of Epirus }} claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus.  Alexander the Great, son of the Epirote princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.  He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion {{ Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles }} while passing Troy.  In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla, while on his way to war against Parthia, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles tumulus.  Achilles fought and killed the Amazon {{ Amazons }} Helene {{ Helene (Amazon) }} .  Some also said he married Medea, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius {{ Apollonius of Rhodes }} Argonautica.  In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive Briseis.
Achilles in Greek tragedy
The Greek tragedian {{ tragedy }} Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title Achilleis by modern scholars.  The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris {{ Paris (mythology) }} and guided by Apollo punctures his heel.  Extant fragments of the Achilleis and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  The first part of the Achilleis trilogy, The Myrmidons, focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.  In Platos Symposium, Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.  The tragedian Sophocles also wrote The Lovers of Achilles, a play with Achilles as the main character.  Only a few fragments survive.  Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in Hecuba {{ Hecuba (play) }} , Electra {{ Electra (Euripides) }} , and Iphigenia in Aulis.

The philosopher Zeno of Elea centered one of his paradoxes {{ Zenos paradoxes }} on an imaginary footrace between "swift-footed {{ Epithets in Homer#Individuals }} " Achilles and a tortoise {{ Zenos paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise }} , by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible.  As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.
Achilles in Roman and medieval literature
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.  Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.  Other writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles erotic career.  This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maures Roman de Troie and Guido delle Colonnes Historia destructionis Troiae, which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century. Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon, not as Hellene {{ Hellenes }} , but as Scythian {{ Scythians }} , while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas, his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars.
Modern and popular culture
(1821–1859) (Musée Fabre). ]]  In 1890, Elisabeth of Bavaria (the Empress of Austria) had a summer palace built in Corfu.  The building is named the Achilleion {{ Achilleion (Corfu) }} , after Achilles.  Its paintings and statuary depict scenes from the Trojan war, with particular focus on Achilles.  Achilles is portrayed as a former hero who has become lazy and devoted to the love of Patroclus, in William Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida.  Achilles appears in Dantes Inferno {{ Inferno (Dante) }} .  He is seen in Hells Circle of Lust.  Achilles is the subject of the poem Achilleïs, a fragment by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

" Achilles (Akhilles) is killed by a poisoned Kentaur arrow shot by Kassandra in Marion Zimmer Bradleys novel The Firebrand (1987).  In Disneys Hercules {{ Hercules (1997 film) }} , Achilles was mentioned to have been a student of Philoctetes and a reference to his heel being his weakness was made.  Later in the film, some people of Thebes mock Philoctetes for his training of Achilles.

Achilles is a main character in Terence Hawkins 2009 novel The Rage of Achilles.  Achilles armor appears as downloadable content in the 2013 video game, God of War: Ascension.  In the web series, RWBY, the character Pyrrha Nikos alludes to Achilles.  Like him, she is a very skilled warrior, wielding a javelin called Miló, which can also turn into a rifle and a xiphos, and a shield called Akoúo̱.  Her name and gender is a reference to when Achilles was disguised as a girl named "Pyrrha" in Skyros.  In the finale of Volume 3, when she is killed by the villain Cinder Fall, Pyrrha is crippled with an arrow at the right heel and turned into ashes, alluding to Achilles death and cremation.  In the video game, Halo 5: Guardians, The Achilles Armor and Helmet are the most challenging cosmetic items to obtain.  The description for the armor "Only Spartans who have mastered themselves, bound their wrath and passion within a shell of hyper-dense steel fueled by star-fire, are granted access to the Achilles.

Telephus
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus.  In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal".  Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.  According to other reports in Euripides lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis {{ Aulis (ancient Greece) }} pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound.  Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge.  Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes {{ Orestes (mythology) }} for ransom, the ransom being Achilles aid in healing the wound.  Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it.  Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.
Troilus
According to the Cypria (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles Wrath), when the Achaeans {{ Achaeans (Homer) }} desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed Troilus.  In Dares Phrygius Account of the Destruction of Troy, the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priams (or sometimes Apollo) and Hecubas five legitimate sons.  Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders.  Prophecies linked Troilus fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him.  Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth nbsp;– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.  Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers embrace.  In this version of the myth, Achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.  Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.  Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible.
Achilles in the Iliad
Homers Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles deeds in the Trojan War.  Achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem.  The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles death.  It begins with Achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonored by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean {{ Achaeans (Homer) }} forces.  Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave.  Her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begs Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him.  Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father.  Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles battle prize Briseis, daughter of Briseus be brought to him to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.  At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnons theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor. As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, Nestor {{ Nestor (mythology) }} declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior.  Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains, Ajax {{ Ajax (mythology) }} and Phoenix {{ Phoenix (son of Amyntor) }} , to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts.  Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do. The Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships.  With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle, wearing Achilles armor, though Achilles remains at his camp.  Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.  After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companions death.  His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles.  She persuades Hephaestus to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector.  The new armor includes the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail in the poem. Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed.  The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself takes note of Achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself.  Finally, Achilles finds his prey.  Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, in the form of Hectors favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face.  After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable.  Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses.  Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him.  Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me".  Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot.  After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honor.  With the assistance of the god Hermes, Hectors father, Priam, goes to Achilles tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hectors body so that he can be buried.  Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral.  The poem ends with a description of Hectors funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.
Penthesilea
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the Amazonian {{ Amazons }} warrior queen Penthesilea, but later grieved over her death.  At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual.  Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.
Memnon, and the fall of Achilles
Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles closest companion was Nestors son Antilochus.  When Memnon {{ Memnon (mythology) }} , king of Ethiopia {{ Ethiopia (mythology) }} slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon.  The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess. Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliads description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles reaction to it.  The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic {{ Epic Cycle }} Aethiopis, which was composed after the Iliad, possibly in the 7th century B. C.  The Aethiopis is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.  The death of Achilles, as predicted by Hector with his dying breath, was brought about by Paris {{ Paris (mythology) }} with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius).  In some versions, the god Apollo guided Paris arrow.  Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.  All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield.  His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus, and funeral games were held.  He was represented in the Aethiopis as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube. Another version of Achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena.  Achilles asks Priam for Polyxenas hand in marriage.  Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior.  But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. In the Odyssey, Agamemnon informs Achilles of his burial mound while they are receiving the dead suitors in Hades.  He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean.  Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.  Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles.
Fate of Achilles armor
Achilles armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax {{ Ajax (mythology) }} (Ajax the greater).  They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus.  Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.  Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades.  After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide.  Odysseus eventually gave the armor to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. A relic claimed to be Achilles bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf.  The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the Iliad with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear.  However, it was shown in the time of Pausanias {{ Pausanias (geographer) }} in the 2nd century AD.
Achilles, Ajax and a game of petteia
Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions.  At some point in the war, Achilles and Ajax {{ Ajax (mythology) }} were playing a board game (petteia).  They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.  The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.

<TEXT>Intro
Abraham Lincoln ( ; February 12, 1809 nbsp;– April 15, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th {{ List of Presidents of the United States }} President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 {{ Assassination of Abraham Lincoln }} .  Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War {{ American Civil War }} —its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.  In doing so, he preserved the Union {{ Union (American Civil War) }} , paved the way to the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy. Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the western frontier {{ American frontier }} in Kentucky and Indiana.  Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader {{ Whig Party (United States) }} , and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, in which he served for eight years.  Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads.  Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress, and because his opposition to the Mexican–American War was unpopular among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to Springfield {{ Springfield, Illinois }} and resumed his successful law practice.  Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new Republican Party {{ History of the United States Republican Party }} , which had a statewide majority in Illinois.  In 1858, while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates {{ Lincoln–Douglas debates }} with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A.  Douglas, Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the U. S.  Senate race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state.  Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 {{ United States presidential election, 1860 }} .  Lincolns victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House—no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession.  Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union {{ Union (American Civil War) }} .  As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats, who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads {{ Copperhead (politics) }} ), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination.  Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political patronage, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.  His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war.  His primary goal was to reunite the nation.  He suspended habeas corpus, leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision, and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861.  Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, Ulysses S.  Grant.  He also made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the Souths normal trade, moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system.  Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond {{ Richmond, Virginia }} ; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded.  As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U. S.  Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states {{ Border States (American Civil War) }} to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery. An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election {{ United States presidential election, 1864 }} .  Anticipating the wars conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction {{ Reconstruction Era of the United States }} , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness.  On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E.  Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.  Secretary of War Edwin Stanton launched a manhunt for Booth, and 12 days later on April 26, Booth was fatally shot by Union Army soldier Boston Corbett. Lincoln has been consistently ranked {{ Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results }} both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U. S.  presidents.
Early career and militia service
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem {{ Lincolns New Salem }} , Illinois.  Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share.  That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly.  He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost.  He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.  Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War.  Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly.  At , he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival".  At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him.  Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.  Lincoln served as New Salems postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously.  He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone {{ William Blackstone }} s Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books.  Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody".  His second campaign in 1834 was successful.  He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a Whig {{ Whig Party (United States) }} , many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.  Admitted to the bar {{ Admission to the bar in the United States }} in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under John T.  Stuart, Mary Todds cousin.  Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments.  He partnered with Stephen T.  Logan from 1841 until 1844.  Then Lincoln began his practice {{ Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site }} with William Herndon {{ William Herndon (lawyer) }} , whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man".  Successful on his second run for office, Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.  He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner.  In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.  He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism {{ Abolitionism in the United States }} .  He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils. " His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.
U. S.  House of Representatives, 1847–49
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay".  The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.  In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U. S.  House of Representatives {{ United States House of Representatives }} , where he served one two-year term.  He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.  Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R.  Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia {{ Washington, District of Columbia }} with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter.  He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.  On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican–American War, which he attributed to President Polk {{ James K.  Polk }} s desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood".  Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U. S.  territory won from Mexico.  Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions.  The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U. S.  Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil .  Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.  Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district.  One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln".  Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.  Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election {{ United States presidential election, 1848 }} .  Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, Justin Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincolns view, an "old fossil".  The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory.  This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.
Prairie lawyer
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer".  Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.  Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges.  As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.  In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case {{ Hurd v.  Rock Island Bridge Company }} involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.  In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device {{ Abraham Lincolns patent }} for the movement of boats in shallow water.  The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.  In 1851, he represented the Alton Sangamon Railroad {{ Alton Railroad }} in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A.  Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.  Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barrets pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barrets payment.  The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court {{ Supreme Court of Illinois }} has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.  Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.  From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincolns largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad.  Lincolns reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname "Honest Abe. " Lincolns most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.  The case is famous for Lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness.  After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility.  Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.  Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judges decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client.  Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.
Assassination and funeral
Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Fords Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close.  The assassination occurred five days after the surrender of Robert E.  Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.  Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.  In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N.  Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners.  After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.  Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Fords Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes.  Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14.  At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.  Lincolns bodyguard, John Parker, left Fords Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door.  The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony.  Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 nbsp;pm, aimed at the back of Lincolns head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President.  Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.  After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington.  After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26.  Doctor Charles Leale, an Army surgeon, found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse.  Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally.  The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House.  After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 nbsp;am on April 15.  Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages. " Lincolns flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the citys church bells rang.  President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 nbsp;am, less than 3 hours after Lincolns death.  The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21.  For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach "United States" and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train {{ Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln#Funeral train }} decorated in black bunting bore Lincolns remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D. C.  to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.  Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomd to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president.  Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news.  African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost their Moses.  In a larger sense, the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.
Religious and philosophical beliefs
As a young man, Lincoln was a religious skeptic {{ religious skepticism }} , or, in the words of a biographer, an iconoclast {{ iconoclasm }} .  Later in life, Lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical {{ Evangelicalism }} Protestants.  He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife.  However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it.  He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others.  Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs.  However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.  In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.  In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.  When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God.  The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.  After Willies death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary.  He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest.  Yet the contest began.  And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day.  Yet the contest proceeds. " On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.
Health
Several claims abound that Lincolns health was declining before the assassination.  These are often based on photographs {{ List of photographs of Abraham Lincoln }} appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting.  One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, MEN2b {{ Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b }} , which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas {{ Mucosal neuromata with endocrine tumors }} and a Marfanoid appearance {{ Marfanoid }} .  Others simply claim he had Marfan syndrome, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (DeMussets sign {{ De Mussets sign }} ) nbsp;— based on blurring of Lincolns head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time.  , DNA analysis was being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia.
Historical reputation
In surveys of U. S.  scholars ranking presidents {{ Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States }} conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one.  A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington.  In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls.  Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1.  Lincoln; 2.  George Washington; and 3.  Franklin D.  Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.  President Lincolns assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr.  Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty.  Republicans linked Lincolns name to their party.  Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.  Historians have said he was "a classical liberal" in the 19th century sense.  Allen C.  Guelzo states that Lincoln was a::classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to Mill, Cobden, and Bright (whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office).  Lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across Europe and Latin America and even in Asia.  Schwartz argues that Lincolns American reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement.  The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D. C.  In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state.  In the Cold War years, Lincolns image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.  By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives {{ Conservatism in the United States }} for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of Lockean {{ John Locke }} and Burkean {{ Edmund Burke }} principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.  As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats {{ Jacksonian Democracy }} .  William C.  Harris found that Lincolns "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism".  James G.  Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform".  Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called radicalism which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders. " By the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals led by Lerone Bennett Jr. , rejected Lincolns role as the Great Emancipator.  Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.  He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks.  Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves {{ American Colonization Society }} to another country.  Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.  The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.  Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincolns image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century.  On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".  In the 21st century, President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincolns Bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations.  Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.
Memory and memorials
Lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny {{ Penny (United States coin) }} and the $5 bill {{ United States five-dollar bill }} .  His likeness also appears on many postage stamps {{ U. S.  presidents on U. S.  postage stamps#Abraham Lincoln }} and he has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital {{ Lincoln, Nebraska }} of Nebraska.  While he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year old Grace Bedell. The most famous and most visited memorials are Lincolns sculpture on Mount Rushmore; Lincoln Memorial, Fords Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) in Washington, D. C. ; and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, not far from Lincolns home {{ Lincoln Home National Historic Site }} , as well as his tomb {{ Lincolns Tomb }} .  There was also the Great Moments with Mr.  Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland, and the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World, which had to do with Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy. Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined Americas cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life".  During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful".  Franklin D.  Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan.  Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?" However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness".  He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.  The United States Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.
Early life and ancestry
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas {{ Thomas Lincoln }} and Nancy Hanks Lincoln {{ Nancy Lincoln }} , in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm {{ Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park }} near Hodgenville, Kentucky.  He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an English {{ English people }} man who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk to its namesake of Hingham, Massachusetts in 1638.  Samuels grandson and great-grandson began the familys western migration, which passed through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  Lincolns paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln {{ Abraham Lincoln (captain) }} , moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky in the 1780s.  Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid {{ Northwest Indian War }} in 1786.  His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, the future presidents father, witnessed the attack.  After his fathers murder, Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier, working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee, before settling with members of his family in Hardin County, Kentucky in the early 1800s.  Lincolns mother, Nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks birth has ever been found.  According to William Ensign Lincolns book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln, Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock.  Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.  Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky, following their marriage.  They became the parents of three children: Sarah, born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and another son, Thomas, who died in infancy.  Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky, including the Sinking Spring farm, where Abraham was born; however, a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move.  In 1811, the family moved eight miles (13 nbsp;km) north, to Knob Creek Farm, where Thomas acquired title to of land.  In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm.  Of the 816. 5 acres (330 ha) that Thomas held in Kentucky, he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles.  Frustrated over the lack of security provided by the Kentucky title survey system in the courts, Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814, and began planning a move to Indiana, where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.  In 1816, the family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana, a free, non-slaveholding territory, where they settled in an "unbroken forest" in Hurricane Township, Perry County {{ Perry County, Indiana#History }} .  (Their land in southern Indiana became part of Spencer County, Indiana, when the county was established in 1818. ) The farm is preserved as part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial.  In 1860, Lincoln noted that the familys move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery"; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky.  During the familys years in Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.  He owned farms, several town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners.  Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.  Within a year of the familys arrival in Indiana, Thomas claimed title to of Indiana land.  Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County.  Prior to the familys move to Illinois in 1830, Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.   Several significant family events took place during Lincolns youth in Indiana.  On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness, leaving eleven-year-old Sarah {{ Sarah Lincoln Grigsby }} in charge of a household that included her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancys nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin.  On December 2, 1819, Lincolns father married Sarah "Sally" Bush Johnston {{ Sarah Bush Lincoln }} , a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.  Abraham became very close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as "Mother".  Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarahs death on January 20, 1828, while giving birth to a stillborn son.  As a youth, Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life.  Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc. ", and must have done it to avoid manual labor.  His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy "physical labor", but loved to read.  Lincoln was largely self-educated.  His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.  Family, neighbors, and schoolmates of Lincolns youth recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible, Aesops Fables, Bunyan {{ John Bunyan }} s The Pilgrims Progress, Defoe {{ Daniel Defoe }} s Robinson Crusoe, Weemss The Life of Washington, and Franklin {{ Benjamin Franklin }} s Autobiography, among others.  As he grew into his teens, Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household.  He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one.  Abraham became adept at using an axe.  Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic.  He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as "the Clarys Grove boys".  In early March 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state, and settled in Macon County {{ Macon County, Illinois }} , west of Decatur {{ Decatur, Illinois }} .  Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana, and one possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had.  After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his fathers lack of education, and occasionally lent him money.  In 1831, as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead {{ Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site }} in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own.  Traveling down the Sangamon River, he ended up in the village of New Salem {{ Lincolns New Salem }} in Sangamon County {{ Sangamon County, Illinois }} .  Later that spring, Denton Offutt, a New Salem merchant, hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers.  After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—Lincoln returned to New Salem, where he remained for the next six years.
Marriage and children
According to some sources, Lincolns first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.  She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever.  In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.  Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem.  Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship.  On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship.  She never replied and the courtship ended.  In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd {{ Mary Todd Lincoln }} , who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington {{ Lexington, Kentucky }} , Kentucky.  They met in Springfield {{ Springfield, Illinois }} , Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.  A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincolns initiative.  They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Marys married sister.  While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose. " In 1844, the couple bought a house {{ Lincoln Home National Historic Site }} in Springfield near Lincolns law office.  Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.  He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.  Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846.  Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis.  "Willie" Lincoln {{ William Wallace Lincoln }} was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862.  The Lincolns fourth son, Thomas "Tad" Lincoln {{ Tad Lincoln }} , was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.  Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children.  The Lincolns last descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died in 1985.  Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.  The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents.  Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.  Abraham Lincoln suffered from "melancholy {{ History of depression }} ", a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression {{ Major depressive disorder }} .  Lincolns father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders.  Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.  During his term as President of the United States of America, Mary was known to cook for Lincoln often.  Since she was raised by a wealthy family, her cooking abilities were simple, but satisfied Lincolns tastes, which included, particularly, imported oysters.
Slavery and a "House Divided"
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been outlawed in all the northern states since 1803, including Illinois, whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery.  Lincoln disapproved of slavery, but he only demanded the end to the spread of slavery to new territory in the west.  He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting Missouri Compromise (1820).  Senior Senator Stephen A.  Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty {{ Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term "popular sovereignty" and its pejorative connotation }} into the Act.  Douglas provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U. S.  territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress.  Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress.  Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles {{ Republicanism in the United States }} of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence {{ United States Declaration of Independence }} .   On October 16, 1854, in his "Peoria Speech {{ Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech }} ", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.  Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery.  I cannot but hate it.  I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.  I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world nbsp;. " In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U. S.  Senate.  At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.  After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull.  Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig.  Lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbulls antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.  Nationally, the Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue.  Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [. ] I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. " Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil {{ Free Soil Party }} , Liberty {{ Liberty Party (United States, 1840) }} , and antislavery Democratic Party {{ Democratic Party (United States) }} members, the new Republican Party {{ Republican Party (United States) }} formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery.  Lincoln was one of those instrumental in forging the shape of the new party; at the 1856 Republican National Convention, he placed second in the contest to become its candidate for vice president.  In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President James Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party.  Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state.  In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v.  Sandford; Chief Justice Roger B.  Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution.  Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power.  Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity, but they did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. " After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U. S.  Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech {{ Lincolns House Divided Speech }} , drawing on , "A house divided against itself cannot stand.  I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided.  It will become all one thing, or all the other. " The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.  The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U. S.  senator.
Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech
The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.  The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically.  Lincoln warned that "The Slave Power" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.  The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands.  Lincoln stated Douglas popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nations morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states.  Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U. S.  Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.  Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate.  Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.  In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the states 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.  On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union {{ Cooper Union speech }} to a group of powerful Republicans.  Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery.  Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".  Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly —Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination.  Journalist Noah Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience. " Historian Donald {{ David Herbert Donald }} described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rivals (William H.  Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rivals (Salmon P.  Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery".  In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste is in my mouth a little. "
1860 Presidential nomination and campaign
On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.  Lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis {{ David Davis (Supreme Court justice) }} , Norman Judd {{ Norman B.  Judd }} , Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.  Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincolns supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate".  In 1860 Lincoln described himself : "I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes. " A biographer added that he had a: :Large head, with high crown of skull; thick, bushy hair; large and deep eye-caverns; heavy eyebrows; a large nose; large ears; large mouth; thin upper and somewhat thick under lip; very high and prominent cheek-bones; cheeks thin and sunken; strongly developed jawbone; chin slightly upturned; a thin but sinewy neck, rather long; long arms; large hands; chest thin and narrow as compared with his great height; legs of more than proportionate length, and large feet.  On May 18, at the Republican National Convention {{ 1860 Republican National Convention }} in Chicago, Lincolns friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H.  Seward and Salmon P.  Chase.  A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket.  Lincolns success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.  On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top.  Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.  Lincolns managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincolns strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".  Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan.  Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats.  Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention {{ 1860 Democratic National Convention }} , disagreeing with Douglas position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected John C.  Breckinridge as their candidate.  Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide teen {{ Youth wing }} and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties.  As Lincolns ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters.  People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.  As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches.  Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party.  The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials.  There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincolns life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty.  The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  The Republican Partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincolns life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.
1860 election and secession
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A.  Douglas, John C.  Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell {{ John Bell (Tennessee politician) }} of the new Constitutional Union Party {{ Constitutional Union Party (United States) }} .  He was the first president from the Republican Party.  His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.  Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes.  Turnout was 82. 2 nbsp;percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.  Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.  Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.  Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the electoral college {{ United States Electoral College }} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123.  There were fusion tickets {{ Electoral fusion }} in which all of Lincolns opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.   As Lincolns election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.  On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.  Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America.  The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.  President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.  The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.  There were attempts at compromise.  The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Partys free-soil platform.  Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent nbsp;.  to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right. " Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states.  That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent.  A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.  Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.  En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.  The president-elect then evaded possible assassins {{ Baltimore Plot }} in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincolns head of security, Allan Pinkerton.  On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D. C. , which was placed under substantial military guard.  Lincoln directed his inaugural address {{ Lincolns first inaugural address }} to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states: The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be enemies nbsp;.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. " The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible.  By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms.  Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.  Lincoln said as the war was ending::Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.
Beginning of the war
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson {{ Robert Anderson (Civil War) }} , sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war.  On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter {{ Battle of Fort Sumter }} , forcing them to surrender, and began the war.  Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.  William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.  Historian Donald {{ Donald, David Herbert }} concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft.  Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood.  But he also vowed not to surrender the forts.  The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that. " On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.  This call forced the states to choose sides.  Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of Richmond {{ Richmond, Virginia }} so close to Union lines.  North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months.  Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.  The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to the defense of the American nation.  Historian Allan Nevins says: :The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment nbsp;.  Anger swept the land.  From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures. " States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincolns call to save the capital and confront the rebellion.  On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops {{ Baltimore riot of 1861 }} who were changing trains, and local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital.  The Army responded by arresting local Maryland {{ Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law }} officials.  Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus {{ Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War }} in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington.  John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U. S.  troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B.  Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ.  Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.
Assuming command for the Union in the war
After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion.  Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers.  He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.  Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions.  In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.   The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention.  From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army.  Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue.  Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.  On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act {{ Confiscation Act of 1861 }} that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort.  In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.  In late August 1861, General John C.  Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri.  He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed.  Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption.  Lincoln overruled Frémonts proclamation.  Lincoln believed that Fremonts emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.  After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.  Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward.  At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain.  The U. S.  Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U. S.  cheered.  Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats.  Biographer James G.  Randall has dissected Lincolns successful techniques::his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Departments attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for Americas true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.  Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department {{ United States War Department }} headquarters.  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party).  In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary {{ United States Secretary of War }} .  Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction.  Nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official.  "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman.  In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.  Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.  Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini {{ Antoine-Henri Jomini }} ; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River.  Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg {{ Vicksburg, Mississippi }} and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army, rather than simply capturing territory.
General McClellan
After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B.  McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies.  McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted.  The campaigns objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital.  McClellans repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington.  Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellans troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.   Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862, after McClellans "Harrisons Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.  The office remained empty until July, when Henry Halleck was selected for it.  McClellans letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope {{ John Pope (military officer) }} , a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia.  Pope complied with Lincolns strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.  However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.  The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia {{ CSS Virginia }} , formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor {{ USS Monitor }} .  Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.  Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellans failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.  Two days after McClellans return to command, General Robert E.  Lees forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862.  The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January.  Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.  McClellan then resisted the Presidents demand that he pursue Lees retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee.  As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside.  Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.   Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg {{ Battle of Fredericksburg }} in December.  Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined.  Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.  Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.  The mid-term elections {{ United States House of Representatives elections, 1862 }} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law {{ Conscription }} , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market.  The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.  While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.  The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York.  The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".  In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hookers attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grants on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks.  He ignored Lincolns order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harpers Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted.  He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lees army avoided capture.  At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.  After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans.  Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.
Emancipation Proclamation
by Francis Bicknell Carpenter (1864)|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men. ]]Lincoln understood that the Federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states.  He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U. S.  territory.  At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery.  Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers {{ Founding Fathers of the United States }} , under the constitution.  President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C.  Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.  On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory.  In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.  Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congresss power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature.  He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action.  In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.  In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".  Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated.  However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification.  Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862.  Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U. S.  president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was that of preserving the Union:  The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.  Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.  Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed.  Lincolns comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper. " For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies {{ Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization }} for the newly freed slaves.  He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.  A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors Conference; they supported the presidents Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B.  McClellan as commander of the Union Army.  Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers.  In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once".  By the end of 1863, at Lincolns direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.  Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".
Gettysburg Address (1863)
With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots.  The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.  Defying Lincolns prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.  In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal".  He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all.  The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort.  He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".  Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.
General Grant
Meades failure to capture Lees army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed.  General Ulysses S.  Grants victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army.  Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I cant spare this man.  He fights. " With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.  Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was.  Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grants political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grants promotion to commander of the Union Army.  He obtained Congresss consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.  Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864.  This is often characterized as a war of attrition {{ attrition warfare }} , given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor {{ Battle of Cold Harbor }} .  Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces".  The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grants plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer. " The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lees army shrank with every costly battle.  Grants army moved south, crossed the James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia.  Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grants headquarters at City Point, Virginia.  This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.  Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.  Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the Souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting.  Grants move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South.  This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginias Shenandoah Valley.  The damage caused by Shermans March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies.  Mark E.  Neely Jr.  has argued that there was no effort to engage in "total war" against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.  Confederate general Jubal Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital.  During Earlys raid on Washington, D. C.  {{ Battle of Fort Stevens }} in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes {{ Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.  }} shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.  As Grant continued to wear down Lees forces, efforts to discuss peace began.  Confederate Vice President Stephens {{ Alexander H.  Stephens }} led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads {{ Hampton Roads Conference }} .  Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.  On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lees forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond.  Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero.  On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox {{ Appomattox Court House National Historical Park }} and the war was effectively over.
1864 re-election
While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864.  Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M.  Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well.  Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.  At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate.  To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party {{ National Union Party (United States) }} .  When Grants 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the Presidents re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated.  Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.  While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B.  McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.  Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort.  Shermans capture of Atlanta in September and David Farraguts capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln.  By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.  On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers vote.  On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address {{ Lincolns second inaugural address }} .  In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be Gods will.  Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world".  Lincoln said:
Reconstruction
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves.  Shortly after Lees surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let em up easy. " In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep.  Thaddeus Stevens, Sen.  Charles Sumner and Sen.  Benjamin Wade, political allies of the president on other issues.  Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war.  His Amnesty Proclamation {{ Ten percent plan }} of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.   As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed.  Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson {{ Andrew Johnson#General }} and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively.  In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P.  Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it.  Lincolns Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans political aspirations.  On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864.  When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Lincolns appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness.  To fill Chief Justice Taneys seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P.  Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.  After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment.  Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter".  By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage.  This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives.  Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864.  After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.  Upon ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.  As the war drew to a close, Lincolns presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen.  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumners Freedmens Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves.  The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen.  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction.  Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction.  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.  Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen.  Lincoln biographers James G.  Randall and Richard Current, according to David Lincove, argue that::It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnsons, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnsons mistakes.  Eric Foner argues that::Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation.  He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land.  He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states.  He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates.  But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.  nbsp;.  Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves nbsp;.  It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death. "
Redefining the republic and republicanism
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country.  The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency.  The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.  In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincolns redefinition of republican values.  As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.  The Declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitutions tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate.  As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. " His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.  Burton (2008) argues that Lincolns republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.  In March 1861, in Lincolns first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy.  He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system.  He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. "
Other enactments
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them.  Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.  He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost.  The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state.  The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869.  The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.   Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax.  In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan.  Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U. S.  income tax.  This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ }} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.  Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in several other areas.  The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country.  It also established a national currency.  In 1862, Congress created, with Lincolns approval, the Department of Agriculture {{ United States Department of Agriculture }} .  In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "Sioux Uprising {{ Dakota War of 1862 }} " in Minnesota.  Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota {{ Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota) }} who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).  President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.  In the wake of Grants casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued.  In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce {{ The Journal of Commerce }} published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market.  Lincolns reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers.  The seizure lasted for two days.  Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday {{ Thanksgiving (United States) }} in the United States.  Before Lincolns presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.  The last such proclamation had been during James Madisons presidency 50 years before.  In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.  In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.
States admitted to the Union
West Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union.  As a condition for its admission, West Virginias constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery.  Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.

Supreme Court appointments
Noah Haynes Swayne – 1862 Samuel Freeman Miller – 1862 David Davis {{ David Davis (Supreme Court justice) }} – 1862 Stephen Johnson Field – 1863 Salmon Portland Chase {{ Salmon P.  Chase }} – 1864 (Chief Justice) Lincolns declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it.  Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known. " Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court.  Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union.  Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist.  David Davis, Lincolns campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincolns Illinois court circuit.  Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat.  Finally, Lincolns Treasury Secretary, Salmon P.  Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864.  Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.
Other judicial appointments
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the United States district courts.  Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.

<TEXT>Intro
Aristotle ( ; , , Aristotélēs; 384–322 nbsp;BC) was an ancient Greek {{ Ancient Greece }} philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira {{ Stagira (ancient city) }} , Chalkidice {{ Chalkidiki }} , on the northern periphery of Classical Greece.  His father, Nicomachus {{ Nicomachus (father of Aristotle) }} , died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.  At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Platos {{ Plato }} Academy {{ Platos Academy }} in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c.  {{ Circa }} nbsp;347 nbsp;BC).  His writings cover many subjects – nbsp;including physics {{ Physics (Aristotle) }} , biology {{ Aristotles biology }} , zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry {{ Poetics (Aristotle) }} , theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government nbsp;– and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.  Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 nbsp;BC.  Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies.  He established a library in the Lyceum {{ Lyceum (Classical) }} which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books.  The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Platos death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.  He believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception.  Aristotles views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works. Aristotles views on physical science {{ Aristotelian physics }} profoundly shaped medieval scholarship.  Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment {{ Age of Enlightenment }} and theories such as classical mechanics.  Some of Aristotles zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century.  His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic. In metaphysics, Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought {{ Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400) }} during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic {{ Scholasticism }} tradition of the Roman Catholic Church.  Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as "The First Teacher" ( }}). His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.  All aspects of Aristotles philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.  Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues – nbsp;Cicero described his literary style as "a river of gold" nbsp;– it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.
Life
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose", was born in 384 nbsp;BC in Stagira {{ Stagira (ancient city) }} , Chalcidice, about 55 nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki.  His father Nicomachus {{ Nicomachus (father of Aristotle) }} was the personal physician to King Amyntas of {{ Amyntas III of Macedon }} Macedon.  Aristotle was orphaned at a young age.  Although there is little information on Aristotles childhood, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy {{ Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court }} .  At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Platos Academy {{ Platonic Academy }} .  He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 nbsp;BC.  The traditional story, about his departure, records that he was disappointed with the Academys direction after control passed to Platos nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato died.   (1791–1882)]]Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor.  There, he traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island.  Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermiass adoptive daughter or niece.  She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias.  Soon after Hermias death, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander {{ Alexander the Great }} in 343 nbsp;BC.  Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon.  During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy {{ Ptolemy I Soter }} and Cassander.  Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric {{ Ethnocentricism }} .  In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants".  By 335 nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum {{ Lyceum (Classical) }} .  Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years.  While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus {{ Nicomachus (son of Aristotle) }} .  According to the Suda, he also had an eromenos, Palaephatus of Abydus {{ Palaephatus }} .  This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 nbsp;BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.  He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived.  Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students.  His most important treatises include Physics {{ Physics (Aristotle) }} , Metaphysics {{ Metaphysics (Aristotle) }} , Nicomachean Ethics, Politics {{ Politics (Aristotle) }} , De Anima (On the Soul) and Poetics {{ Poetics (Aristotle) }} . Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them.  In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, embryology, geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology.  In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology.  He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry.  His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.  Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexanders relationship with Persia and Persians.  A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexanders death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim {{ Hagnothemis }} made some six years after the death.  Following Alexanders death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled.  In 322 nbsp;BC, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in Chalcis, at which occasion he was said to have stated: "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy" a reference to Athenss prior trial and execution of Socrates {{ Trial of Socrates }} .  He died in Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will {{ Will (law) }} in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.  Charles Walston argues that the tomb of Aristotle is located on the sacred way between Chalcis and Eretria and to have contained two styluses, a pen, a signet-ring and some terra-cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of Aristotle in the form of some skull fragments.  In general, the details of the life of Aristotle are not well-established.  The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.
Loss and preservation of his works
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotles "lost" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus.  Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.  Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.  The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotles at all.  Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the Constitution of Athens {{ Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle) }} , are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotles "school," perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision.  Others, such as On Colors, may have been produced by Aristotles successors at the Lyceum, e. g. , Theophrastus and Straton {{ Strato of Lampsacus }} .  Still others acquired Aristotles name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the De Plantis, possibly by Nicolaus of Damascus.  Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical {{ magic (paranormal) }} texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.  According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "exoteric" and the "esoteric".  Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the Lyceum course / school (esoteric).  Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotles own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).  However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.  The 5th century neoplatonist Ammonius Hermiae writes that Aristotles writing style is deliberately obscurantist {{ Obscurantism }} so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these. " Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotles extant writings are of the esoteric kind.  Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form.  (Fragments of some of Aristotles dialogues have survived. ) Perhaps it is to these that Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotles writing style as "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.  However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Ciceros praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotles extant works.  One major question in the history of Aristotles works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us.  The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives.  The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis.  Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens.  According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text.  When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.  Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B. C. " Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however.  First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicons inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis.  Third, the definitive edition of Aristotles texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his.  And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess.  Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the Politics {{ Politics (Aristotle) }} , for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact. On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotles school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the dialogues and other "exoteric" texts {{ Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments }} which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime.  The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.
Legacy
More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.  He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields.  According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did".  Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.  Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotles errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably.  Bertrand Russell notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine".  Russell also refers to Aristotles ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy".  Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.
List of works
The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum.  These texts, as opposed to Aristotles lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotles school.  Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekkers Royal Prussian Academy edition (Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.
Eponyms
The Aristotle Mountains along the Oscar II Coast of Graham Land, Antarctica, are named after Aristotle.  He was the first person known to conjecture, in his book Meteorology {{ Meteorology (Aristotle) }} , the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it "Antarctica".  Aristoteles {{ Aristoteles (crater) }} is a crater on the Moon bearing the classical form of Aristotles name.

Logic
With the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic.  Kant {{ Immanuel Kant }} stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that Aristotles theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotles philosophy aims at the universal {{ Universality (philosophy) }} .  Aristotles ontology, however, finds the universal in particular things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Platos ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar {{ wikt:exemplar }} .  For Aristotle, therefore, epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms {{ Theory of Forms }} (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.  For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see Universals and particulars {{ Aristotle#Universals and particulars }} , below).  In a certain sense, Aristotles method is both inductive {{ Inductive reasoning }} and deductive {{ Deductive reasoning }} , while Platos is essentially deductive from a priori {{ A priori and a posteriori }} principles.  In Aristotles terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences.  In modern times, the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role.  Todays philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method.  In contrast, Aristotles philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science".  Note, however, that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method".  For Aristotle, "all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (Metaphysics 1025b25).  By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.  If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) Logic; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy. In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today.  In fact, most of Aristotles life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science.  Aristotles metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics.  He did, however, perform original research in the natural sciences, e. g. , botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences. Aristotles writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.  Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotles work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate.  His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature.  He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers. His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors.  For example, in his History of Animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.  In a similar vein, John Philoponus, and later Galileo {{ Galileo Galilei }} , showed by simple experiments that Aristotles theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.  On the other hand, Aristotle refuted Democrituss claim that the Milky Way was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then nbsp;.  the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them. " In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over-stretched reason.  Todays scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of ones hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws. Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots.  He posited a geocentric cosmology {{ geocentrism }} that we may discern in selections of the Metaphysics, which was widely accepted up until the 16th century.  From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational center of the universe {{ History of the Center of the Universe }} . Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotles erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.  However, Aristotles scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields.  For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia.  Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.
Geology
As quoted from Charles Lyells {{ w:Charles Lyell }} Principles of Geology: He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages.  He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized.  He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time nbsp;.  He alludes nbsp;.  to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.  The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten. He says [12th chapter of his Meteorics] the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.  The concluding observation is as follows: As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever.  The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time.  So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.
Metaphysics
Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of immaterial {{ hylomorphism }} being," or of "being in the highest degree of abstraction. " He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science".
Biology and medicine
In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition.  He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.
Psychology
Aristotles psychology, given in his treatise On the Soul (peri psyche, often known by its Latin title De Anima), posits three kinds of soul ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul.  Humans have a rational soul.  This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally.  The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them. For Aristotle, the soul (psyche) was a simpler concept than it is for us today.  By soul he simply meant the form {{ Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism }} of a living being.  Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e. g.  the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).
Views on women
Aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.  On this ground, feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism.  However, Aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.
Later Greek philosophers
The immediate influence of Aristotles work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school.  Aristotles notable students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus {{ Nicomachus (son of Aristotle) }} , and Theophrastus.  Aristotles influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers.  He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher.  Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotles geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all mens common property?"
Influence on Byzantine scholars
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus.  The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were John Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century.  John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotles views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.  After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.
Influence on Islamic theologians
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology.  Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars.  Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers.  Alkindus considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers.  Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher".  The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante {{ Dante Alighieri }} ) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.  In accordance with the Greek {{ Greeks }} theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with Plato essential tenets of thought.  Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.
Influence on Western Christian theologians
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c.  AD 600 to c.  1100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius.  In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona, and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke. After Thomas Aquinas wrote his theology, working from Moerbekes translations, the demand for Aristotles writings grew and the Greek {{ Greek language }} manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance.  Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by Scholastic {{ Scholasticism }} thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas (see Summa Theologica, Part I, Question 3, etc. ).  These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages.  It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.  The medieval English poet Chaucer {{ Geoffrey Chaucer }} describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heedTwenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,Of aristotle and his philosophie, The Italian poet Dante {{ Dante Alighieri }} says of Aristotle in the first circles of hell {{ The Divine Comedy }} , vidi l maestro di color che sannoseder tra filosofica famiglia. Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno:quivi vidïo Socrate e Platoneche nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;  I saw the Master there of those who know,Amid the philosophic family,By all admired, and by all reverenced;There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,Who stood beside him closer than the rest. :—Dante, LInferno (Hell), Canto IV.  Lines 131–135
Post-Enlightenment thinkers
The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.  However debatable this is, Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ("natural slaves {{ slavery }} "), and the natural superiority (virtue, arete) of others.  It is Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.  Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.  More recently, Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.
History
Aristotle "says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of".  However, Plato reports that syntax was devised before him, by Prodicus of Ceos, who was concerned by the correct use of words.  Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications.  Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system, he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his dialectic.  Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion {{ Logical consequence }} would logically follow.  Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial.  He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book Sophist {{ Sophist (dialogue) }} , where he introduced his division method.
Analytics and the Organon
What we today call Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics".  The term "logic" he reserved to mean dialectics.  Most of Aristotles work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers.  The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:# Categories# On Interpretation# Prior Analytics# Posterior Analytics# Topics# On Sophistical RefutationsThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotles writings.  It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations).  The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning.  There is one volume of Aristotles concerning logic not found in the Organon, namely the fourth book of Metaphysics.
Five elements
Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by Empedocles.  Earth {{ Earth (classical element) }} , which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.  Water {{ Water (classical element) }} , which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.  Air {{ Air (classical element) }} , which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.  Fire {{ Fire (classical element) }} , which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma {{ Plasma (physics) }} and heat.  Aether {{ Aether (classical element) }} , which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres {{ Celestial spheres }} and heavenly bodies (stars and planets). Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place.  All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i. e. , the center of the Earth.  Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center.  Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere.  Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits).  When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it.  This is "natural motion" – motion requiring no extrinsic cause.  So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.  Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.
Motion
Aristotle defined motion {{ Motion (physics) }} as the actuality of a potentiality as such.  Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state.  Because actuality and potentiality {{ Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality }} are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it.  ====Causality, the four causes====  Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.  His name aitia is traditionally translated as "cause", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as "explanation", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.  Material cause describes the material out of which something is composed.  Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel.  It is not about action.  It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.  The formal cause is its form, i. e. , the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype.  It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i. e. , macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation.  Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter.  Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation.  A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.  The efficient cause is "the primary source", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds.  It identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest.  Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.  So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.  The final cause (telos) is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities.  The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve.  This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs. Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal.  (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect. ) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes.  Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event.  Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord. Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation.  All causes, both proper and incidental, can be spoken of as actual or potential, and as generic or particular.  The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes, generic effects to generic causes, and particular effects to particular causes.
Optics
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day.  The second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura (after Mozi c.  400 BC) can be found in Aristotles documentation of such a device in 350 nbsp;BC in Problemata.  Aristotles apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or aperture, to allow for sunlight to enter.  Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object.  In modern cameras, this is analogous to the diaphragm {{ Diaphragm (optics) }} .  Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.
Chance and spontaneity
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause.  Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things {{ sumbebekos }} .  It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance).  For a better understanding of Aristotles conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations.  That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum.  However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance.  It must be unusual that something happens by chance.  In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance. There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions.  According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice.  "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".
Substance, potentiality and actuality
Aristotle examines the concepts of substance {{ Substance theory }} and essence (ousia) in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form.  In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum {{ Material substratum }} , or the stuff of which it is composed.  For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc. , or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia {{ Genus-differentia definition }} (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house.  The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.  With regard to the change (kinesis {{ Potentiality and actuality }} ) and its causes now, as he defines in his Physics {{ Physics (Aristotle) }} and On Generation and Corruption 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;# locomotion, which is change in space; and# alteration, which is change in quality. The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property.  In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (dynamis {{ Dunamis }} ) and actuality (entelecheia) in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else.  For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant.  Potentially beings can either act (poiein) or be acted upon (paschein), which can be either innate or learned.  For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise nbsp;– acting). Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality.  Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end.  Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.  For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired.  For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.   In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end.  Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i. e. , matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.
Universals and particulars
Aristotles predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things.  When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple.  In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple.  Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things.  For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form.  Bertrand Russell is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals". Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated.  Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things.  According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated.  Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals.  As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.  So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.
Empirical research program
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail.  Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas.  The works that reflect this research, the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, and Parts of Animals, contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes.  The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen.  His observations on catfish, electric fish {{ Electric ray }} (Torpedo {{ Torpedo (genus) }} ) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on cephalopods, namely, Octopus, Sepia (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo).  His description of the hectocotyl arm {{ hectocotylus }} , used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century.  He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (selachians).  An example of his methods, including dissection and observation, comes from the Generation of Animals, where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated.  Aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous {{ Ovoviviparity }} embryological development of the hound shark Mustelus mustelus.
Classification of living things
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds, mammals and fishes.  What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood.  Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish).  Invertebrates (animals without blood) are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i. e. , final causes, guided all natural processes.  Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design.  Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary.  Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.  He stated in the History of Animals that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae {{ Great chain of being }} or great chain of being.  His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth.  The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.  For Charles Singer, "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotles] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a scala naturae".  Aristotle also held that the level of a creatures perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form.  Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times. He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.  Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.  Notable is Aristotles division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon {{ Alcmaeon of Croton }} .
Successor: Theophrastus
Aristotles successor at the Lyceum {{ Lyceum (Classical) }} , Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany – the History of Plants – which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages.  Many of Theophrastus names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotles concept of the efficient cause.  Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.
Influence on Hellenistic medicine
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.  Though interest in Aristotles ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.  It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies {{ Ptolemaic dynasty }} that advances in biology can be again found. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon {{ Herophilos }} , corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation.  Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries {{ artery }} , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.  Though a few ancient atomists {{ atomism }} such as Lucretius challenged the teleological {{ teleology }} viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.  Ernst Mayr claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance. " Aristotles ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.
Memory
According to Aristotle, memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal "appearance" and an occurrence in the past.  In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm {{ wikt:phantasm }} ) in which Aristotle defines in De Anima, as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory.  Aristotle believed an "imprint" becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory.  A memory occurs when a stimuli {{ stimulus (psychology) }} is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once.  These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation {{ sense }} , common sense, and thinking .  The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception.  It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory Aristotle uses the word "memory" for two basic abilities.  First, the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic "imprint" that can develop from sensation.  Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the "imprint" due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents.  These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time.  Therefore, memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present.  The retrieval of our "imprints" cannot be performed suddenly.  A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience. Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the "imprint" can easily continue.  However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new "imprints".  He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an "imprint".  Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderlys organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new "imprints".  Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ.  Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have perception of time.
Ethics
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i. e. , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake.  He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the Nicomachean Ethics. Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (ergon) of a thing.  An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight.  Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē {{ De Anima }} (normally translated as soul) in accordance with reason (logos).  Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being".  To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ēthikē aretē {{ arete (moral virtue) }} ), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).  Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things.  When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical {{ theory }} or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.
Politics
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled Politics {{ Politics (Aristotle) }} .  Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community.  Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part".  He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal" and also arguing that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom {{ Animal }} is its rationality.  Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.  Aristotles conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.  The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotles understanding.  Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (polis) which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" (koin?nia) .  The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together . " This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences. " Excerpt from a speech by the character Aristotle in the book Protrepticus {{ Protrepticus (Aristotle) }} (Hutchinson and Johnson, 2015 p.  nbsp;22) :For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i. e. , the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i. e.  a discourse based on intelligence.  And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad.  And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity.  Hence its evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.
Rhetoric and poetics
Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry {{ Dithyramb }} and music to be imitative {{ Mimesis }} , each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.  For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language.  The forms also differ in their object of imitation.  Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average.  Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.  Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankinds advantages over animals.  While it is believed that Aristotles Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived.  Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.  The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy.  Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions.  Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis.  He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.  Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle {{ Pythia }} and studied the fables of Aesop.
Recollection
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or "imprints", people are continually weaving together new "imprints" of things they experience.  In order to search for these "imprints", people search the memory itself.  Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for.  Recollection {{ Recall (memory) }} occurs when one experience naturally follows another.  If the chain of "images" is needed, one memory will stimulate the other.  If the chain of "images" is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances.  When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.  Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory "imprint" after some time has passed.  Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses.  Only humans will remember "imprints" of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words.  Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations.  Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.  Recollection of an "imprint" is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences.  When an "imprint" is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related "imprints".  Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain "imprints", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity.  These three laws make up his Laws of Association.  Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind.  A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience.  According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.
Sleep
Before understanding Aristotles take on dreams, first his idea of sleep must be examined.  Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness.  Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized.  While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness.  Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which is the result of a sensation.  However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences.  Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.
Theory of dreams
Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep.  In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake.  Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water.  When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion.  When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.  When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant.  However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made.  So, dreams result from these lasting impressions.  Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.  During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind.  Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus.  For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings.  When a person is asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings.  Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.  When asleep, a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream.  This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real.  Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not.  So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it. One component of Aristotles theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs.  He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being.  Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations.  These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.  Aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not.  He claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it.  If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred.  Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream.  For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream.  The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream.  Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.

<DOCTITLE>An American in Paris</DOCTITLE>
<DOCID>309</DOCID>
<TEXT>Intro
An American in Paris is a jazz-influenced symphonic poem by the American composer George Gershwin, written in 1928.  Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris, it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions. Gershwin composed An American in Paris on commission from the conductor Walter Damrosch.  He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta, saxophones, and automobile horns.  He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December nbsp;13, 1928, in Carnegie Hall, with Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic.  Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the works premiere.  Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer Deems Taylor, noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere. " When the tone poem moves into the blues, "our American friend .  has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness. " But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease. " The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant. "
Background
Gershwin was attracted by Maurice Ravels unusual chords.  After transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether Ravel took students and how much he charged, Ravel looked at Gershwins prior year earnings and sent a telegram to Gershwin jokingly saying he (Ravel) should study with Gershwin.  But Ravel accepted him as a student, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study.  After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he couldnt teach him but he would send a letter referring him to Nadia Boulanger.  While the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of An American in Paris written as a thank you note to Gershwins hosts, Robert and Mabel Shirmer.  Gershwin called it "a rhapsodic ballet" written so freely and much more modern than his prior works. Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour, something Ravel had been reluctant to do.  To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravels friend Robert Schmitz, a pianist Ravel had met during the War to urge Ravel to tour the U. S.  Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica promoting Franco-American musical relations and was able to offer Ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.   Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in February 1928 at the start of Ravels U. S.  Tour, and joined Ravel again later in the tour in Los Angeles.  After a lunch together with Chaplin in Beverly Hills, Ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in a friends music salon, performing among kindred spirits. Ravels tour reignited Gershwins desire to return to Paris which he did in March 1928.  Ravels high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris.  Yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him.  Nadia Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students "Dont copy others; be yourself. " In this case "Why try to be a second rate Ravel when you are already a first rate Gershwin?" This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his Rhapsody in Blue.  Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them Ezra Pound, W.  B.  Yeats, Ernest Hemingway; and artist Pablo Picasso.
Composition
Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer.  He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works.  Gershwin explained in Musical America, "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere. "The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose ABA format {{ Ternary form }} .  Gershwins first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio".  The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six.  This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns.  The B sections "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness.  The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues.  In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum.  "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A.  After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso. ?
Instrumentation
An American in Paris is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B-flat {{ soprano clarinet }} , bass clarinet in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horn {{ French horn }} s in F, 3 trumpets in B-flat, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, triangle {{ Triangle (musical instrument) }} , wood block, cymbals, low and high tom-tom {{ Tom-tom drum }} s, xylophone, glockenspiel, celesta, 4 taxi horns {{ vehicle horn }} labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, alto saxophone/soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, baritone saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and strings {{ String section }} .  Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light that Gershwins intention was to have used the notes A 4 {{ Scientific pitch notation }} , B 4 , D 5 , and A 4 .  It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played. The revised edition by F.  Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone.  In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments. William Daly {{ William Merrigan Daly }} arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.
Response
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of An American in Paris.  He stated that Damroschs sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work.  The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses. " Critics believed that An American in Paris was better crafted than his lukewarm Concerto in F {{ Concerto in F (Gershwin) }} .  Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck, Richard Wagner, or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere.  Gershwin responded to the critics, "Its not a Beethoven Symphony, you know.  Its a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it.  Its not intended to draw tears.  If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds. "
Preservation status
On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological critical edition {{ Historical editions (music) }} of the full orchestral score will be eventually released.  The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwins true intent.  It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwins composition process.  The score to An American in Paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released.  The entire project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, but An American in Paris will be an early volume in the series.  Two urtext editions of the work have been published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015.  The changes made by Campbell-Watson have been withdrawn in both editions.  In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music have been re-integrated.  Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.
Recordings
An American in Paris has been frequently recorded.  The first recording was made for RCA Victor in 1929 with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.  This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A flat, B flat, a higher C and a lower D.  The radio broadcast of the September nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which An American in Paris, also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.  Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the music in Carnegie Hall, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.  The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwins original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.  Harry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album One Night Stand, recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago (Columbia {{ Columbia Records }} GL 522 and CL 522).  Conductor Steven Richman and Harmonie Ensemble/New York released a recording of Gershwins original orchestrations in 2016 on Harmonia Mundi/[PIAS] including American in Paris.
Use in film
In 1951, MGM released the musical film An American in Paris {{ An American in Paris (film) }} , featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.  Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the An American in Paris symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green), costing $500,000.

<TEXT>Intro
The Academy Awards, now known officially as the Oscars, is a set of twenty-four awards for artistic and technical merit in the American film industry, given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academys voting membership.  The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit", which has become commonly known by its nickname "Oscar".  The awards, first presented in 1929 {{ 1st Academy Awards }} at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS.  The awards ceremony was first broadcast on radio in 1930 and televised for the first time in 1953.  It is now seen live in more than 200 countries and can be streamed live online.  The Academy Awards ceremony is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony.  Its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music and recording – are modeled after the Academy Awards.  The 89th Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2016 {{ 2016 in film }} , were held on February 26, 2017, at the Dolby Theatre, in Los Angeles, California.  The ceremony was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel and was broadcast on ABC {{ American Broadcasting Company }} .  A total of 3,048 Oscars have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 88th {{ 88th Academy Awards }} .
History
The first Academy Awards {{ 1st Academy Awards }} presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people.  The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.  The cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was $5 ($ in dollars).  Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period.  The ceremony ran for 15 nbsp;minutes. Winners were announced to media three months earlier, however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930.  Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.  This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.
Nomination
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January.  Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.
Venues
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.  From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel {{ Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles) }} on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel {{ Millennium Biltmore Hotel }} in downtown Los Angeles. Graumans Chinese Theatre {{ TCL Chinese Theatre }} in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948.  The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what was the Academys headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.  From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywoods Pantages Theatre {{ Pantages Theatre (Hollywood) }} .  With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the NBC International Theatre {{ Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle) }} (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre {{ New Century Theatre }} , after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles.  The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California in 1961.  By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center {{ Los Angeles Music Center }} . In 2002, the Dolby Theatre (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentations current venue.
Special categories
The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole.  They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis.
Associated events
The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards: César Award Nominees luncheon Governors Awards The 25th Independent Spirit Awards (in 2010), usually held in Santa Monica the Saturday before the Oscars, marked the first time it was moved to a Friday and a change of venue to L. A.  Live The annual "Night Before", traditionally held at the Beverly Hills Hotel, begun in 2002 and generally known as the party of the season, benefits the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which operates a retirement home for SAG actors in the San Fernando Valley Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party airs the awards live at the nearby Pacific Design Center The Governors Ball is the Academys official after-party, including dinner (until 2011), and is adjacent to the awards-presentation venue The Vanity Fair after-party, historically at the former Mortons restaurant, since 2009 has been at the Sunset Tower
Presenter and performer gifts
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars.  In recent years, these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.  The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars.  In 2014 the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000.  The value has risen to the point where the U. S.  Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.  Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, videophones, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, vacation packages, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy.  Some of the gifts have even had a "risque" element to them; in 2014 the adult products retailer Adam Eve {{ Adam Eve (company) }} had a "Secret Room Gifting Suite".  Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag, Carolyn Hennesy, Kate Linder, Chris Mulkey, Jim OHeir, and NBA player John Salley.

Institutions
The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command {{ The Last Command (1928 film) }} and The Way of All Flesh {{ The Way of All Flesh (1927 film) }} .  He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history.  At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films.  With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.  For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.  At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film {{ Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film }} category was introduced.  Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award. The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies always end with the Academy Award for Best Picture.
Other awards presented by the Academy
:See also (below). In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually): Governors Awards: The Academy Honorary Award (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette);  The Irving G.  Thalberg Memorial Award (since 1938) (in the form of a bust of Thalberg); The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (since 1957) (in the form of an Oscar statuette);  The Academy Scientific and Technical Awards: Academy Award of Merit (non-competitive) (in the form of an Oscar statuette); Scientific and Engineering Award (in the form of a bronze tablet); Technical Achievement Award {{ Academy Award for Technical Achievement }} (annual) (in the form of a certificate); The John A.  Bonner Medal of Commendation (since 1978) (in the form of a medal); The Gordon E.  Sawyer Award (since 1982); and The Academy Student Academy Awards (annual). The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting.
Academy Award of Merit (Oscar statuette)
:See also (below)The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.  Made of gold-plated britannium {{ britannia metal }} on a black metal base, it is 13. 5 nbsp;in (34. 3 nbsp;cm) tall, the award weighs 8. 5 nbsp;lb (3. 856 nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusaders {{ crusades }} sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes.  The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.  The model for the statuette is said to be Mexican actor Emilio "El Indio" Fernández {{ Emilio Fernández }} .  Sculptor George Stanley {{ George Stanley (sculptor) }} (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Cedric Gibbons design.  The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze.  Within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.  Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years.  Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.  The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base.  The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C. W.  Shumway Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes.  From 1983 to 2015, approximately 50 Oscars were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R. S.  Owens Company.  It takes between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.  In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to Rock Tavern, New York-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry.  While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the new statuettes will retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal.  Cast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn, New York–based Epner Technology.  The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly 3 months.  R. S.  Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy and service existing Oscars.
Naming
The origin of the name Oscar is disputed.  One biography of Bette Davis, who was a president of the Academy, claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson.  Another claimed origin is that the Academys Executive Secretary, Margaret Herrick, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuettes reminding her of her "Uncle Oscar" (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).  Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herricks naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette Oscar. " One of the earliest mentions of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine {{ Time (magazine) }} article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards.  Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932.  The trophy was officially dubbed the "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Engraving
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates.  Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied.  Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governors Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony.  In 2010, the R. S.  Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner.  The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.
Ownership of Oscar statuettes
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1.  If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette.  Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.  In December 2011, Orson Welles 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.  On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.  In 1992, Harold Russell needed money for his wifes medical expenses.  In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in New York City, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500.  Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first.  Russell defended his decision, saying, "I dont know why anybody would be critical.  My wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons.  The movie will be here, even if Oscar isnt. " Harold Russell is the only Academy Award-winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.  While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.  Michael Todds {{ Mike Todd }} grandson tried to sell Todds Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction.  Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.
Voters
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 .  Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production.  Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academys composition.  Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) for the past 83 annual awards ceremonies.  All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees.  Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures. New membership proposals are considered annually.  The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.  The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members.  While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.  In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS voting membership.  Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60.  33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).  In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.
Rules
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).  For example, the 2009 Best Picture {{ Academy Award for Best Picture }} winner, The Hurt Locker, was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards {{ 81st Academy Awards }} as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards {{ 82nd Academy Awards }} .  Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.  Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 nbsp;minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a 35 mm {{ 35 mm film }} or 70 mm film print or in 24 nbsp;frame/s or 48 nbsp;frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels.  Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year.  The form includes the production credits for all related categories.  Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases. In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members.  For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i. e.  only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc. ).  In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees.  In all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.  In certain categories, including Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members.  Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting.  Since 2013, re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects {{ Academy Award for Best Visual Effects }} .  Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season.  The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified.  It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.  For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (The Hurt Locker eventually won).
Telecast
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees.  It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year.  This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day.  Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this.  (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast. )The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when ABC {{ American Broadcasting Company }} took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts.  ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976, and has broadcast the Oscars ever since; its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.  The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots.  The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast.  By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries.  A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries. The ceremonies were moved up from late March or early April to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns {{ For Your Consideration (advertising) }} associated with Oscar season in the film industry.  Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Championship, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience.  The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period.  Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics {{ Winter Olympic Games }} .  Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.  Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.  The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys {{ Emmy Awards }} in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.  After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 nbsp;pm Eastern {{ Eastern Time Zone }} /6:00 p. m Pacific {{ Pacific Time Zone }} , in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30 nbsp;pm Pacific.  The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.  For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.  The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season.  However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).  Also, a January or early-February ceremony held on a Sunday would have to compete with National Football League playoff games such as the Super Bowl.  Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination {{ Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  }} of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.  {{ Martin Luther King Jr.  }} .  On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the shooting {{ Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan }} of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D. C. In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.  This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.  Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a "popularity contest" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours.  The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 nbsp;minutes.  At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.  In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches {{ Oscar speech }} must not run past 45 nbsp;seconds.  This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.  In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker {{ news ticker }} .  Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards have steadily dropped; the 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18-49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception.  Following the show, Variety {{ Variety (magazine) }} reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself.  Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.  In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract does not contain any notable changes, nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.
TV ratings
Historically, the "Oscarcast" has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy.  More than 57. 25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, the year of Titanic {{ Titanic (1997 film) }} , which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.  The 76th Academy Awards ceremony in which The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43. 56 million viewers.  The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date, however, was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture Midnight Cowboy) which drew a 43. 4% household rating on 7 April 1970.  By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings.  The 78th Academy Awards which awarded low-budgeted, independent film Crash {{ Crash (2004 film) }} (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53. 4 million) generated an audience of 38. 64 million with a household rating of 22. 91%.  In 2008, the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31. 76 million viewers on average with an 18. 66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film (No Country for Old Men {{ No Country for Old Men (film) }} ).
Current categories
In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy).  At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical).  From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films).  Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup. Another award, entitled the Academy Award for Best Original Musical, is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued.  However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when Purple Rain {{ Purple Rain (film) }} won).
Proposed categories
The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories.  To date, the following proposed categories have been rejected: Best Casting: rejected in 1999  Best Stunt Coordination: rejected every year from 1991 to 2012  Best Title Design: rejected in 1999
Current special categories
:For a list of all nine awards, see (above) Academy Honorary Award: since 1929 Academy Scientific and Technical Award (three different awards): since 1931 Gordon E.  Sawyer Award: since 1981 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award: since 1957  Irving G.  Thalberg Memorial Award: since 1938
Discontinued special categories
Academy Juvenile Award: 1934 to 1960 Academy Special Achievement Award {{ Special Achievement Academy Award }} : 1972 to 1995
Accusations of commercialism
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "Oscar season".  This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality.  William Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself".  Tim Dirks, editor of AMCs {{ American Movie Classics }} filmsite. org, has written of the Academy Awards,
Accusations of bias
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U. S.  the last three months of the calendar year.  The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded.  This has led to the coining of the term Oscar bait, describing such movies.  This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e. g. , by favoring Oscar bait over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.
Allegations of a lack of diversity
The 88th awards ceremony {{ 88th Academy Awards }} became the target of a boycott, based on critics perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.  In response, the Academy initiated "historic" changes in membership by the year 2020.
Symbolism or sentimentalization
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work.
Refusing the award
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars.  The first to do so was Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer {{ The Informer (1935 film) }} ).  Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild.  George C.  Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for Patton {{ Patton (film) }} ) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony.  Scott described it as a meat parade, saying I dont want any part of it. " The third was Marlon Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972s The Godfather), citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.

Reception
In Movie - Film - Review, Daily Mail staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were "competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers", the film "is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident".  Noting that there were "occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness", they did not "justify comparisons to All About Eve", and were "insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with Rashomon".  He also wrote that The Guardian called the film a "slow, stuffy chamber-piece", and that The Evening Standard stated the films "best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesomes composed veneers".  MRQE wrote "This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story. "

International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name ) is a high-precision atomic coordinate {{ coordinate time }} time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earths geoid.  It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earths surface, and for Terrestrial Time, which is used for astronomical calculations.  when another leap second was added, TAI is exactly 37 seconds ahead of UTC.  The 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972. TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth.  Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.
Operation
TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.  The clocks are compared using GPS {{ Global Positioning System }} signals and two-way satellite time and frequency transfer.  Due to the signal averaging it is an order of magnitude more stable than its best clock alone would be.  The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks {{ Atomic clock }} ; the definition of the SI {{ International System of Units }} second is written in terms of caesium.  The participating institutions each broadcast, in real time {{ real-time data }} , a frequency signal with timecodes, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form UTC(NPL) in the UTC form, where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory, UK.  The TAI form may be denoted TAI(NPL).  The latter is not to be confused with TA(NPL), which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else. The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2. bipm. fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the canonical {{ Canonical form }} TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(k) (equivalent to TAI-TAI(k)) for each participating institution k.  (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(k), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales. )Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time (TT).
History
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously.  Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL) {{ National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) }} .  The "Greenwich Atomic" (GA) scale began in 1955 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.  The International Time Bureau (BIH) began a time scale, T m or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals.  The United States Naval Observatory began the A. 1 scale 13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado.  Both the BIH scale and A. 1 were defined by an epoch {{ epoch (reference date) }} at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204. 5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding UT2 instant.  The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: "A3" in 1963 and "TA(BIH)" in 1969.  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the astronomical {{ astronomy }} realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second. The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds.  During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected.  In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.  In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144. 5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name EAL (Echelle Atomique Libre, meaning Free Atomic Scale).  The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144. 5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32. 184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time. ) TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32. 184 nbsp;s.  The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated "In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC. " UTC is a discontinuous (i. e.  regularly adjusted by leap seconds) time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time.  From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated UT2.  Afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate UT1.  This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIHs atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally.  The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.

<TEXT>Intro
Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare {{ Quality of life }} of others.  It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions.  Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness.  The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism.  He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning "other people {{ alterity }} " or "somebody else".  Altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e. g. , pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.  Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".  Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty, in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships.  Much debate exists as to whether "true" altruism is possible in human psychology.  The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification.  The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards {{ Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation }} qualify as "benefits".  The actor also may not be expecting a reward. The term altruism {{ altruism (ethics) }} may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others.  Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with egoism {{ ethical egoism }} , which is defined as acting to the benefit of ones self.
The notion of altruism
The concept has a long history in philosophical {{ Philosophy }} and ethical {{ Ethics }} thought.  The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists {{ ethology }} .  Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism.  In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
Religious viewpoints
Most, if not all, of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value.  Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism and Sikhism, etc. , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
Philosophy
There exists a wide range of philosophical views on mans obligations or motivations to act altruistically.  Proponents of ethical altruism {{ Altruism (ethics) }} maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically.  The opposing view is ethical egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest.  Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants. A related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible.  Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones self-interest (without specifying how this affects ones moral obligations).

Anthropology
Marcel Mausss book The Gift contains a passage: "Note on alms. " This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice.  In it, he writes: Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other.  Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it.  This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice.  The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.   Compare Altruism (ethics) – perception of altruism as self-sacrifice {{ altruism (ethics) }} .  Compare explanation of alms in various scriptures {{ alms }} .
Evolutionary explanations
In the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness {{ fitness (biology) }} of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.  In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping {{ Tip (gratuity) }} , courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.  Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins.  Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies. Some of the proposed mechanisms are: Kin selection.  That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures.  Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior.  One kinship cue is facial resemblance.  One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons.  Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior.  Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group.  Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study.  This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.   Vested interests.  People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear.  Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist.  Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness.  Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup {{ Ingroups and outgroups }} threatens to kill the entire ingroup.   Reciprocal altruism.  See also Reciprocity (evolution).  Direct reciprocity {{ Reciprocity (social psychology) }} .  Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help.  The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic {{ game theory }} example.  Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.  ::One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future.  People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower.  They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors.  Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead of a "Wall Street Game. " ::A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them.  This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity.  Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation.  The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped.  On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating.  People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts.  As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.  ::People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first.  This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises.  They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately.  Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population.  Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individuals performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.   Indirect reciprocity.  The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a persons reputation to become very important.  A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.   Strong reciprocity.  A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism.  A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.  Pseudo-reciprocity.  An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.  Costly signaling {{ Signalling theory }} and the handicap principle.  Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources.  This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner.  It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling.  It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help.  Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.  :Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else.  Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating ones resources.  Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.   :Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions.  One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else.  This have been documented in many studies.  The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen.  Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.  Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.  People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.  :Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners.  When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children.  It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman.  While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man.  Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.  :People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism.  On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous.  This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic.  The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present.  While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.  :Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards.  This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable.  Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them.  This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators.  A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.   Group selection.  It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as David Sloan Wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level.  Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons.  Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism).  Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.   Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts.  Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.  Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment.  This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.  The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups.  Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.  The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R.  Prices development of the Price equation, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution.  An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as Dictyostelium {{ Dictyostelid }} mucoroides.  These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.  Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian Left.
Neurobiology
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-DOr Hospital Network (J. M. ) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging.  In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic {{ Mesolimbic pathway }} reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex.  However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region.  These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species.  Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.  One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy.
Psychology
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare. " Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism, which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.  There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.  Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.  However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question.  The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.  Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory.  He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism).  Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.  The empathy-altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering.  Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions.  People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering.  Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.   In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.  Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress.  Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect).  Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.  However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.  A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.  Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism {{ volunteering }} (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being.  In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression {{ Depression (mood) }} , anxiety {{ anxiety (mood) }} , and somatization.  Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages.  One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.  A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying.  After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.  Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being.  A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.  It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder.  The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional.  Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.  Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.  For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).  Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others.  Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being.  A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being. ".  Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others, doing good and subsequently feeling good as "the helpers high".
Sociology
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity".  American Sociological Association.  ).  The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field.  The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges Public sociology saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA).  This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies.  How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society".
Pathological altruism
Pathological {{ Pathology }} altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good. The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book Pathological Altruism. Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.
Buddhism
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism.  Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering.  "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion.  These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (Dalai Lama).  Since "all beings" includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other.  It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering.  In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as "altruistic. " Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism, as a religion, is kindness toward others.  Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama ). In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect.  A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.  In Buddhism, karma (P?li kamma) is strictly distinguished from vip?ka {{ vipaka }} , meaning "fruit" or "result".  Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (P?li hetu) in the chain {{ Twelve nidanas }} of cause and effect {{ Pratitya-samutpada }} , where it comprises the elements of "volitional activities" (Pali sankhara) and "action" (Pali bhava).  Any action is understood to create "seeds" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (P?li vipaka) when they meet the right conditions.  Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of sams?ra {{ Samsara (Buddhism) }} ; others will liberate one to nirv?na {{ nirvana }} . Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action.  Motivation usually makes the difference between "good" and "bad", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be "bad" in that it creates unpleasant results for the "actor. "In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens.  As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:  Kamma Niyama — Consequences of ones actions Utu Niyama — Seasonal changes and climate Biija Niyama — Laws of heredity Citta Niyama — Will of mind Dhamma Niyama — Natures tendency to produce a perfect type
Jainism
The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings.  Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i. e.  uncompromising reverence for all life.  It also considers all living things to be equal.  The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things. Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal.  A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors.  Ones unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans.  Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything.  Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action.  The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks.  They are:# Non-violence (Ahimsa);# Truthfulness (Satya);# Non-stealing (Asteya);# Celibacy (Brahmacharya);# Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha);The "great vows" (Mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" (Anuvrata) are prescribed for householders.  The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows.  The monks have to observe them very strictly.  With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress. The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul.  Jainism views every soul {{ Soul (Jainism) }} as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (God in Jainism).  Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in ones actions.  Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small.  This policy extends even to microscopic organisms.  Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.
Christianity
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain.  From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the Pauline {{ Paul the Apostle }} phrase "love seeks not its own interests. " In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many.  Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each persons experience and practice from within.  As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection. St Thomas Aquinas interprets You should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.  Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part.  However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being.  In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte {{ Auguste Comte }} was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism. Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God.  1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of God.  Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love.  An altruistic action is not always a loving action.  Oord defines altruism as acting for the others good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall well-being. German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak.  One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence".  Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, .  nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business. " At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc. , directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse. "
Islam
In Islam, the concept īth?r (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of preferring others to oneself.  For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone.  The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; Islam considers those practicing īth?r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.  This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in ithar attention is focused on everything in existence.  A constant concern for Allah (i. e.  God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.  This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like Rabia al-Adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to Allah (i. e.  God) and dedication to people.  Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet Yunus Emre explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or We love the creature, because of The Creator.  For many Muslims, ithar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays.  However, ithar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.
Judaism
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation.  The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.  This is defined as bestowal {{ Tzedakah }} , or giving, which is the intention of altruism.  This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God.  Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence.  Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.  Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.  Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another.  Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity.
Sikhism
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion.  The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth.  The ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity.  In the late seventeenth century, Guru Gobind Singh Ji (the tenth guru in Sikhism), was in war with the Mughal {{ Mughal Empire }} rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy.  He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield.  Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy.  Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield. "What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru.  "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds.  You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru. "It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism.  This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
Hinduism
Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, a Vedantic text.  In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed.  Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit.  Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya {{ Merit (Buddhism) }} , which gives fruit.  Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god.  It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment. However the very well known and popular text, the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga (selfless action) or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism.  Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.
Initial evolutionary problematics
There are problems of early stage evolution of altruism.  A first emotionally empathic individual would, if it was genetic, have been effectively exploited to death by the preexisting non-empathic individuals.  This applies regardless how far back in evolution the problem is moved, not restricted to hominid but extending to pre-reptilian or anything in between including early mammals.  The first empathic individual would effectively be exploited every time another individual was in the right place at the right time to take advantage, so no evolutionary adaptation to exploiting empathic individuals would be required for the lethality to take effect.  It is de facto impossible that mutations for emotional empathy, ability to recognize it in others, and a direction of it towards those individuals would all occur at the same time.  An ability to recognize a non-existent behavior is of no evolutionary use and so cannot have pre-evolved.

<TEXT>Intro
Ayn Rand ( ; born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum, ; nbsp;– March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter.  She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism {{ Objectivism (Ayn Rand) }} .  Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926.  She had a play produced on Broadway {{ Broadway theatre }} in 1935–1936.  After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged.  Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.  Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge, and rejected faith and religion.  She supported rational {{ rational egoism }} and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism {{ Altruism (ethics) }} .  In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights.  In art, Rand promoted romantic realism.  She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.  Literary critics received Rands fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades.  The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.  She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives {{ Conservatism in the United States }} .
Philosophy
Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. " She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy and aesthetics.  In metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.  In epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses. " She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori {{ A priori and a posteriori }} knowledge, including "instinct, intuition, revelation, or any form of just knowing.  Rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization, which she summarized in the form of a philosophical razor {{ Razor (philosophy) }} .  Known as "Rands razor," it states that "concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity—the corollary of which is: nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity. " In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy.  In ethics, Rand argued for rational {{ rational egoism }} and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle.  She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. " She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her book of that title {{ The Virtue of Selfishness }} , in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of "mans survival qua man".  She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in Atlas Shrugged that "Force and mind are opposites. " Rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights {{ Private property }} ), and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.  She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.  In the The Presidential Candidates 1968, she argued that fascism and communism were "two rival gangs" of statism and rejected them as being opposites in imposing a fraudulent choice between a dictatorship of the rich (fascism) or poor (communism) in favour of a "ruling clique" that eliminated the choice of capitalism and freedom.  She considered fascism a product of the political left as being socialist in being opposed to capitalism.  Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.  Although her political views are often classified as conservative {{ Conservatism in the United States }} or libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism".  She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.  She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.  She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.  In aesthetics, Rand defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value-judgments. " According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.  As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.  She described her own approach to literature as "romantic realism".  Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend "three As"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.  In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me.  I devised the rest of my philosophy myself. " However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rands journals, in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style.  However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsches ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.  Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences. Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force. " She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating, "I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason.  If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows. "

Early life
Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ( ) on February 2, 1905, to a Russian Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg.  She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant Jews.  Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.  With a passion for the liberal arts, Rand later said she found school unchallenging and she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.  At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokovs younger sister, Olga.  The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nabokov mansion {{ Nabokov house }} : while Nabokova defended constitutional monarchy, Rand supported republican ideals.  She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed.  Her father’s business was confiscated and the family displaced.  They fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War.  She later recalled that, while in high school, she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue.  After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.   After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University, where, at the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.  At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.  A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche.  Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.  Along with many other "bourgeois" students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating.  After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which Rand did in October 1924.  She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad.  For one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.  By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand, possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname, and she adopted the first name Ayn, either from a Finnish {{ Finnish language }} name Aino {{ Aino (given name) }} or from the Hebrew word (ayin, meaning "eye").
Arrival in the United States
In the autumn of 1925, Rand was granted a visa {{ Visa (document) }} to visit American relatives.  She departed on January 17, 1926.  When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor".  Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free.  She then set out for Hollywood, California {{ Hollywood }} .  Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses.  A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B.  DeMille led to a job as an extra {{ extra (drama) }} in his film The King of Kings {{ The King of Kings (1927 film) }} as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.  While working on The King of Kings, she met an aspiring young actor, Frank OConnor; the two were married on April 15, 1929.  She became a permanent US resident {{ Permanent residence (United States) }} in July 1929, and became an American citizen {{ United States nationality law#Naturalization }} on March 3, 1931.  Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios.  She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.
Early fiction
Rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.  This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th, first produced by E. E.  Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway {{ Broadway theater }} in 1935.  Each night the "jury" was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jurys "verdict", would then be performed.  In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play {{ The Night of January 16th (film) }} .  Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.  Ideal {{ Ideal (novel) }} is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate.  The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.  Rands first published novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936.  Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state.  In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write.  It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense.  The plot is invented, the background is not. " Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell.  After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.  In 1942, without Rands knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira.  Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living {{ We the Living (film) }} in 1986.  Her novella Anthem {{ Anthem (novella) }} was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead.  It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we.  It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher.  As with We the Living, Rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3. 5 million copies.
The Fountainhead and political activism
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active.  Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie.  This work led to Rands first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie newsreels, an experience she greatly enjoyed.  This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism.  She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises.  Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her.  Once Mises referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman".  Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson.  Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, The God of the Machine.  Rands first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.  The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves.  It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.  While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed Benzedrine, a brand of amphetamine, to fight fatigue.  The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest.  Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.  The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.  In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version {{ The Fountainhead (film) }} to Warner Bros. , and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay.  Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor.  Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar {{ Academy Award }} -nominated Love Letters {{ Love Letters (1945 film) }} and You Came Along.  This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism.  Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow", in the January 1944 edition of Readers Digest magazine.   Rand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood.  She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the groups behalf.  She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association.  A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rands California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.  In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee.  Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia.  Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.  She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.  When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".  After several delays, the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949.  Although it used Rands screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.
Atlas Shrugged and Objectivism
. ]] In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced.  In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her.  This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara {{ Barbara Branden }} , and Barbaras cousin Leonard Peikoff.  At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy.  Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written.  In 1954 Rands close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.  Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, was considered Rands magnum opus {{ Masterpiece }} .  Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in mans existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest. " It advocates the core tenets of Rands philosophy of Objectivism {{ Objectivism (Ayn Rand) }} and expresses her concept of human achievement.  The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike {{ strike action }} and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy.  The novels hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nations wealth and achievement.  With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart.  The novel includes elements of romance {{ Romance novel }} , mystery {{ mystery (fiction) }} , and science fiction, and it contains Rands most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt. Despite many negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller.  In an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive".  After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression.  Atlas Shrugged was Rands last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rands career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.  In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rands philosophy.  Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited.  Rand later published some of these articles in book form.  Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.  Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.  Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.  However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rands closest followers in New York.
Later years
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton {{ Princeton University }} , Columbia {{ Columbia University }} , Harvard, and MIT.  She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis Clark College in 1963.  She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience.  During these speeches and Q A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day.  These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as "bums"), supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as "civilized men fighting savages", saying European colonists {{ European colonization of the Americas }} had the right to develop land taken from American Indians {{ Indigenous peoples of the Americas }} , and calling homosexuality "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.  She also endorsed several Republican {{ Republican Party (United States) }} candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964 {{ United States presidential election, 1964 }} , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter.   In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married.  Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand.  When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.  Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life".  Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement. " In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.  Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.  In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, allowed Evva Pryor, a social worker from her attorneys office, to enroll her in Social Security {{ Social Security (United States) }} and Medicare {{ Medicare (United States) }} .  During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.  One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.  Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City, and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.  Rands funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan.  A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.  In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.
Reviews
During Rands lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation.  Rands first novel, We the Living, was admired by the literary critic H.  L.  Mencken, her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success, and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as "masterful".  Rands novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.  However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.  The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th.  Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.  Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S.  Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications.  Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.  Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.  Rands first bestseller, The Fountainhead, received far fewer reviews than We the Living, and reviewers opinions were mixed.  There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated.  The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time".  There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.  Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing".  Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rands style "offensively pedestrian".  Rands 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.  In the National Review, conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly".  He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets {{ Religion in the Soviet Union }} ), claiming "From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: To a gas chamber—go! Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain {{ John Chamberlain (journalist) }} , but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"; they said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity".  Author Flannery OConnor wrote in a letter to a friend that "The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction.  I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail. " Rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had.  The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, For the New Intellectual, was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged, with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union", and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality".  Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.  On the 100th anniversary of Rands birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for The New York Times, referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian "retro fantasy" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist, while criticizing her characters "isolated rejection of democratic society".  In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as "romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy".  In 2009, GQ s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as "capitalisms version of middlebrow religious novels" such as Ben-Hur {{ Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ }} and the Left Behind series.
Popular interest
In 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondents life was.  Rands Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.  Rands books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 nbsp;million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute).  In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th centurys finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics list.  Although Rands influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.  Rands work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.  Rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L.  Neil Smith, and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her.  Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush {{ Rush (band) }} .  Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.  John Allison {{ John A.  Allison IV }} of BB T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rands ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P.  Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.  Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games.  She, or a character based on her, figures prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors.  Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason {{ Reason (magazine) }} , has remarked that "Rands is a tortured immortality, one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist. " and that "jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture".  Two movies have been made about Rands life.  A 1997 documentary film, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature.  The Passion of Ayn Rand {{ The Passion of Ayn Rand (film) }} , a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name {{ The Passion of Ayn Rand (book) }} , won several awards.  Rands image also appears on a 1999 {{ List of people on stamps of the United States#R }} U. S.  postage stamp {{ Postage stamps and postal history of the United States }} designed by artist Nick Gaetano.
Political influence
Although she rejected the labels "conservative {{ Conservatism in the United States }} " and "libertarian", Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism.  Jim Powell {{ Jim Powell (historian) }} , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism, and David Nolan {{ David Nolan (libertarian) }} , one of the founders of the Libertarian Party {{ Libertarian Party (United States) }} , stated that "without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist".  In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty {{ Brian Doherty (journalist) }} described her as "the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large", and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as "the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right".   She faced intense opposition from William F.  Buckley, Jr.  and other contributors for the National Review magazine.  They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M.  Stanton Evans.  Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.  The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the United States Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist.  A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administrations "novelist laureate".  Republican Congressmen {{ United States Congress }} and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.  The financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis, and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.  During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests.  There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness {{ Rational egoism }} and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.  For example, Mother Jones {{ Mother Jones (magazine) }} remarked that "Rands particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed", while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels.  Corey Robin of The Nation alleged similarities between the "moral syntax of Randianism" and fascism.
Academic reaction
During Rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.  When the first academic book about Rands philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously.  A few articles about Rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in The Personalist.  One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is–ought problem posed by David Hume.  Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rands case.  Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited.  Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rands novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.  Since Rands death, interest in her work has gradually increased.  Historian Jennifer Burns has identified "three overlapping waves" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is "an explosion of scholarship" since the year 2000.  However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.  Gladstein, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, Allan Gotthelf, Edwin A.  Locke and Tara Smith {{ Tara Smith (philosopher) }} have taught her work in academic institutions.  Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rands philosophical and literary work.  In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.  Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rands ideas, including Ayn Rands Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist, a volume on Rands ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press.  Rands ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson {{ Clemson University }} and Duke {{ Duke University }} universities.  Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.  Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B.  Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional".  Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rands ethics are "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought. " In the Literary Encyclopedia {{ The Literary Encyclopedia (English) }} entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation".  In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, "I know they laugh at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.  Libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that very few people find Rands ideas convincing, especially her ethics, which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.  He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist.  Thus, Atlas Shrugged outsells Rands non-fiction works, as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat.  Political scientist Charles Murray {{ Charles Murray (political scientist) }} , while praising Rands literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H.  Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.
Objectivist movement
In 1985, Rands heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rands ideas and works.  In 1990, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society.  In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.  The charitable foundation of BB T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rands ideas or works.  The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants.  In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.

<TEXT>Intro
Allan Dwan (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.
Early life
Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario {{ Toronto }} , Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, née Hunt.  The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old, on 4 December 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939.  His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.  At the University of Notre Dame, Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago.  However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.  At that time, some of the East Coast {{ East Coast of the United States }} movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather.  Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood.  While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.
Career
Dwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California from August 1911 to July 1912.  Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history.  On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California. After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood {{ Robin Hood (1922 film) }} .  Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm.  This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 "Lambs Gambol" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club. Following the introduction of the talkies {{ sound film }} , Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi {{ Heidi (1937 film) }} (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm {{ Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film) }} (1938). Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz {{ The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) }} and Gone With the Wind {{ Gone with the Wind (film) }} , and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer.  Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima.  He directed his last movie in 1961.  He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California. Dwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.

Its capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the countrys far north.  With an area of , Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world {{ list of countries and dependencies by area }} , and the largest in Africa.  Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the west by Morocco, to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory, Mauritania, and Mali, to the southeast by Niger, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea.  The country is a semi-presidential republic {{ Semi-presidential system }} consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties).  Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been President {{ President of Algeria }} since 1999. Ancient Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians {{ Punic }} , Romans {{ Ancient Rome }} , Vandals, Byzantines {{ Byzantine Empire }} , Umayyads, Abbasids, Idrisid, Aghlabid, Rustamid, Fatimids, Zirid, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Spaniards, Ottomans and the French colonial empire {{ French Algeria }} .  Berbers are the indigenous inhabitants of Algeria. Algeria is a regional {{ regional power }} and middle power.  The North African country supplies large amounts of natural gas to Europe, and energy exports are the backbone of the economy.  According to OPEC Algeria has the 16th largest {{ List of countries by proven oil reserves }} oil reserves in the world and the second largest in Africa, while it has the 9th largest reserves {{ List of countries by natural gas proven reserves }} of natural gas.  Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa.  Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget on the continent; most of Algerias weapons are imported from Russia, with whom they are a close ally.  Algeria is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations and is the founding member of the Maghreb Union {{ Arab Maghreb Union }} .
Etymology
The countrys name derives from the city of Algiers.  The citys name in turn derives from the Arabic al-Jaz?ir (الجزائر, "The Islands"), a truncated form of the older Jaz?ir Banī Mazghanna (جزائر بني مزغنة, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"), employed by medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi {{ Muhammad al-Idrisi }} .

File:Seraidi-Annaba. jpg|Edough National Park, Annaba Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the Arab world, and the Mediterranean Basin.  Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara.  To the north, the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands.  Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria.  The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha {{ Tebessa }} occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border.  The highest point is Mount Tahat ( m).  Algeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° {{ 19th parallel north }} and 37°N {{ 37th parallel north }} (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes 9°W {{ 9th meridian west }} and 12°E {{ 12th meridian east }} .  Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural harbours.  The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile.  South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.  The Ahaggar Mountains ( ), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria.  They are located about south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of Tamanghasset.  Algiers, Oran, Constantine {{ Constantine, Algeria }} , and Annaba are Algerias main cities.
Politics
Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria.  Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president.  The most powerful man may be Mohamed Mediène, head of the military intelligence.  In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired.  After the death of General Larbi Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.  The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term.  The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.  Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age.  The President is the head of the army {{ Algerian Army }} , the Council of Ministers {{ Council of Ministers of Algeria }} and the High Security Council.  He appoints the Prime Minister {{ Prime Minister of Algeria }} who is also the head of government.  The Algerian parliament is bicameral; the lower house, the Peoples National Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the Council of the Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president.  According to the constitution {{ Constitution of Algeria }} , no political association may be formed if it is "based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession, or region".  In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.  Parliamentary elections were last held in May 2012 {{ Algerian legislative election, 2012 }} , and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities.  In the elections, the FLN {{ National Liberation Front (Algeria) }} won 221 seats, the military-backed National Rally for Democracy {{ National Rally for Democracy (Algeria) }} won 70, and the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance won 47.
Administrative divisions
Algeria is divided into 48 provinces {{ provinces of Algeria }} (wilayas), 553 districts {{ districts of Algeria }} (daïras) and 1,541 municipalities {{ Municipalities of Algeria }} (baladiyahs).  Each province, district, and municipality is named after its seat {{ Capital city }} , which is usually the largest city. The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence.  When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order.  With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are
Economy
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank {{ World Bank Group }} .  Algerias currency is the dinar {{ Algerian dinar }} (DZD).  The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the countrys socialist post-independence development model.  In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.  Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy.  The governments efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.  The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.  A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases.  Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years.  The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.   The Algerian economy grew by 2. 6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand.  If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4. 8%.  Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4. 2% in 2013.  The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP.  The current-account surplus is estimated at 9. 3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion.  Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.   In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26. 9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus.  In general, the country exported $73 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46 billion.  Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund.  In addition, Algerias external debt {{ List of countries by external debt }} is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.  The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algerias budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.  In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5. 3%, respectively.  About 14% of the labor force are employed in the agricultural sector {{ Agriculture in Algeria }} .  Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.  Algeria has not joined the WTO, despite several years of negotiations.  In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4. 74 nbsp;billion of Algerias Soviet {{ Soviet Union }} -era debt during a visit by Russian President {{ President of Russia }} Vladimir Putin to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century.  In return, Algerian President {{ President of Algeria }} Abdelaziz Bouteflika agreed to buy $7. 5 nbsp;billion worth of combat planes, air-defence systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russias state arms exporter Rosoboronexport.  Dubai-based conglomerate Emarat Dzayer Group said it had signed a joint venture agreement to develop a $1. 6 billion steel factory in Algeria.
Demographics
In January 2016 Algerias population was an estimated 40. 4 nbsp;million, who are mainly Arab-Berber ethnically.  At the outset of the 20th century, its population was approximately four million.  About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the inhabitants of the Sahara desert are mainly concentrated in oases {{ oasis }} , although some 1. 5 nbsp;million remain nomadic or partly nomadic.  28. 1% of Algerians are under the age of 15.  Women make up 70% of the countrys lawyers and 60% of its judges and also dominate the field of medicine.  Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men.  60% of university students are women, according to university researchers.  Between 90,000 and 165,000 Sahrawis {{ Sahrawi people }} from Western Sahara live in the Sahrawi refugee camps, in the western Algerian Sahara desert.  There are also more than 4,000 Palestinian refugees, who are well integrated and have not asked for assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  In 2009, 35,000 Chinese {{ Overseas Chinese }} migrant workers lived in Algeria.  The largest concentration of Algerian migrants outside Algeria is in France, which has reportedly over 1. 7 million Algerians of up to the second generation.
Culture
Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, Tamazight {{ Berber languages }} and French, has been strongly influenced by the countrys recent history.  Famous novelists {{ List of Algerian writers }} of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib, Albert Camus, Kateb Yacine and Ahlam Mosteghanemi while Assia Djebar is widely translated.  Among the important novelists of the 1980s were Rachid Mimouni, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and Tahar Djaout, murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views.  Malek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization; Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste (modern-day Souk Ahras); and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria.  The works of the Sanusi {{ Senussi }} family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted.  The Latin author Apuleius was born in Madaurus (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria. Contemporary Algerian cinema is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues.  There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.
Health
In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1. 13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2. 23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0. 31 per 1,000 people).  Access to "improved water sources" was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas.  Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to "improved sanitation".  According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of "reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015".  Given Algerias young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals.  In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program.  However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause tuberculosis, hepatitis, measles, typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery.  The poor generally receive health care free of charge.  Health records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the South to their Vital record database in 1905 during French rule.
Education
Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78. 7%.   Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling.  From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes.  The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German.  In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.  Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge.  After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution.  The school offers two programs: general or technical.  At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the bachelors degree, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.   Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15.  In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22. 3%, 15. 6% for men and 29. 0% for women.  The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was Algiers Province at 11. 6%, while the province with the highest rate was Djelfa Province at 35. 5%.  Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008.  The University of Algiers, founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters).  25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country. Even if some of them offer instruction in Arabic like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English.  Among the most important universities, there are the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, the University of Mentouri Constantine, and University of Oran Es-Senia.  The University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd in Tlemcen and University of Batna Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa.

Ancient history
In the region of Ain Hanech (Saïda Province), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found.  Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian {{ Levallois technique }} and Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the Levant.  Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques.  Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called Aterian (after the archeological site of Bir el Ater, south of Tebessa). The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian (located mainly in Oran region).  This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC.  Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC.  This life, richly depicted in the Tassili nAjjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period. The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers {{ Berber people }} , who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.    From their principal center of power at Carthage, the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa, east of Cherchell, Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) and Rusicade (modern Skikda).  These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages. As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically.  Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states.  Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.  By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army.  In the Revolt of the Mercenaries {{ Mercenary War }} , Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War.  They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthages North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa.  The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars. In 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed.  As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew.  By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged.  Two of them were established in Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage.  West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the Moulouya River in modern-day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean.  The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissas death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.  Massinissas line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire.  For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region.  Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products.  Saint Augustine {{ Augustine of Hippo }} was the bishop of Hippo Regius (modern-day Algeria), located in the Roman province of Africa {{ Africa (Roman province) }} .  The Germanic Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.  They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes, in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous Laguatan {{ Amazigh }} who had been busy facilitating an Amazigh political, military and cultural revival.
Middle Ages
After negligible resistance from the locals, the Arabs conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith.  After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the Aghlabids, Almohads, Abdalwadid, Zirids, Rustamids, Hammadids, Almoravids and the Fatimids. During the Middle Ages, North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including Judah Ibn Quraysh {{ Judah ibn Kuraish }} the first grammarian to suggest the Afroasiatic {{ Afroasiatic languages }} language family, the great Sufi masters Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan) {{ Abu Madyan }} and Sidi El Houari, as well as the Emirs Abd Al Mumin {{ Abd al-Mumin }} and Y?ghmūrasen {{ Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan }} .  It was during this time period that the Fatimids or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb.  These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, primarily made of Arabs and levantians extending from Algeria to their capital state of Cairo.  The Fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the Zirids seceded.  In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym against them.  The resultant war is recounted in the epic T?ghrib?t {{ Taghribat Bani Hilal }} .  In Al-T?ghrīb?t the Amazigh Zirid Hero Kh?līf? Al-Z?natī {{ Khalifa al-Zanati }} asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī {{ Abu Zayd al-Hilali }} and many other Arab knights in a string of victories.  The Zirids, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture.  The indigenous Amazigh {{ Berber people }} tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids).  The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as Fatimid Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, Palestine {{ Palestine (region) }} , Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Tihamah, Hejaz and Yemen.  Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era. The Amazighs {{ Berber people }} historically consisted of several tribes.  The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes.  Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, Sanhadja, Houara, Zenata, Masmouda {{ Masmuda }} , Kutama, Awarba, and Berghwata).  All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.  Several Amazigh {{ Berber people }} dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands.  Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the Zirid {{ Zirid dynasty }} , Banu Ifran, Maghrawa, Almoravid, Hammadid, Almohad, Merinid, Abdalwadid {{ Zayyanid dynasty }} , Wattasid, Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties.  In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts (presidios) on or near the Algerian coast.  Spain took control of few coastal towns like Mers el Kebir in 1505; Oran in 1509; and Tlemcen, Mostaganem and Ténès in 1510.  In the same year, few merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to Spain, which built a fort on it.  The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for Spains merchant fleet.    There reigned in Ifriqiya, current Tunisia, a Berber {{ Berbers }} family, Zirid {{ Zirid dynasty }} , somehow recognising the suzerainty of the Fatimid {{ Fatimid Caliphate }} caliph of Cairo.  Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Muizz, decided to end this suzerainty.  The Fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Muizz, also found another means of revenge. Between the Nile and the Red Sea were living Bedouin tribes expelled from Arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence, both Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the Nile Valley since the nomads would often loot.  The then Fatimid {{ Fatimid Caliphate }} vizier devised to relinquish control of the Maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign.  This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the Fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance. Whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment.  Some stopped on the way, especially in Cyrenaica, where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in Ifriqiya by the Gabe {{ Gabès Governorate }} s region.  The Zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but each meeting, the last under the walls of Kairouan, his troops were defeated and Arabs remained masters of the field. The flood was still rising and in 1057, the Arabs spread on the high plains of Constantine {{ Constantine, Algeria }} where they gradually choked Qalaa of Banu Hammad {{ Beni Hammad Fort }} , as they had done Kairouan few decades ago.  From there, they gradually gained the upper Algiers and Oran plains, some were forcibly taken by the Almohads in the second half of the 12th century.  We can say that in the 13th century there were in all of North Africa, with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely Berber {{ Berbers }} .
Privateers era
The region of Algeria was partially ruled by Ottomans for three centuries from 1516 to 1830.  In 1516 the Turkish {{ Turkish people }} privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa, who operated successfully under the Hafsids, moved their base of operations to Algiers.  They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the Spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the Bani Ziyad dynasty, to flee.  When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of Tlemcen {{ Kingdom of Tlemcen }} , Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers.  The Ottoman {{ Ottoman Empire }} sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries.  With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).  The next beylerbey was Hayreddins son Hasan {{ Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa) }} , who assumed the position in 1544.  Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits.  Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms.  The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha {{ Agha (Ottoman Empire) }} .  Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha.  As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.  Plague {{ Plague (disease) }} had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa.  Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.  In 1671, the taifa rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power.  The new leader received the title of dey.  After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the divan, a council of some sixty nobles.  It was at first dominated by the ojaq; but by the 18th century, it had become the deys instrument.  In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the pasha in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat.  The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated.  Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly.  Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest.  Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie.   The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.  The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves {{ slavery }} .  They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives.  According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1. 25 million Europeans as slaves.  They often made raids, called Razzias {{ Ghazi (warrior) }} , on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets {{ Arab slave trade }} in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.  In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari, almost the entire population.  In 1551, Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese {{ Malta }} island of Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya.  In 1554, pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slaves.  In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to Istanbul.  Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches.  The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera.  Between 1609 and 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.   In July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers sailed as far as Iceland, raiding and capturing slaves {{ Turkish Abductions }} .  Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from Salé {{ Sale, Morocco }} in Morocco {{ Saadi dynasty }} had also raided in Iceland.  Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland, but some chose to stay in Algeria.  In 1629 pirate ships from Algeria raided the Faroe Islands.  In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "licence tax" in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels.  One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.  Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First {{ First Barbary War }} (1801–1805) and Second Barbary Wars (1815).  Following those wars, Algeria was weaker and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth {{ Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth }} , attacked Algiers {{ Bombardment of Algiers (1816) }} .  After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Captain (later Commodore) Stephen Decatur {{ Stephen Decatur }} (U. S.  Navy) concerning the demands of tributes.  In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians {{ Christian }} .
French colonization (1830–1962)
Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers {{ Invasion of Algiers in 1830 }} in 1830.  Algerine slave trade and piracy ceased when the French conquered Algiers.  The conquest of Algeria {{ French conquest of Algeria }} by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed.  A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous {{ indigenous peoples }} Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.  The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1. 5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960.  French policy was predicated on "civilising" the country.  During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers, mostly Kabyles {{ Kabyle People }} . As a consequence, French government favored the Kabyles.  About 80% of Indigenous schools were constructed for Kabyles.  From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation.  One of Frances longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European {{ European ethnic groups }} immigrants, who became known as colons and later, as Pied-Noirs.  Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.  These settlers benefited from the French governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.  Many Europeans settled in Oran and Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.  During the late 19th and early 20th century; the European share was almost a fifth of the population.  The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900.  The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central Asia and Caucasus, Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.  Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France.  Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began.  Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Libération Nationale {{ National Liberation Front (Algeria) }} (FLN) or by lynch {{ lynching }} mobs in Algeria.  The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals.  The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum {{ Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962 }} .
The first three decades of independence (1962–1991)
The number of European Pied-Noirs who fled Algeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964.  The exodus to mainland France accelerated after the Oran massacre of 1962, in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city, and began attacking civilians.  Algerias first president was the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN {{ FLN (Algeria) }} ) leader Ahmed Ben Bella.  Moroccos claim to portions of western Algeria {{ Greater Morocco }} led to the Sand War in 1963.  Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumediene, his former ally and defence minister.  Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian {{ authoritarianism }} ; Boumédienne continued this trend.  But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role.  He collectivised {{ collective farming }} agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive.  Oil extraction {{ Extraction of petroleum }} facilities were nationalised.  This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis. In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy.  Boumedienes successor, Chadli Bendjedid, introduced some liberal economic reforms.  He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life.  Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.  The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut.  Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system.  Political parties developed, such as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.
Civil War (1991–2002) and aftermath
In December 1991 the Islamic Salvation Front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections {{ Algerian legislative election, 1991 }} .  Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections.  Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State {{ High Council of State (Algeria) }} was installed to act as Presidency.  It banned the FIS, triggering a civil insurgency between the Fronts armed wing, the Armed Islamic Group {{ Armed Islamic Group of Algeria }} , and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died.  The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres {{ List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War }} .  At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight 8969, a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group.  The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.  Algeria held elections in 1999 {{ Algerian presidential election, 1999 }} , considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.  He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a Civil Concord initiative, approved in a referendum {{ Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999 }} , under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000.  The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly.  The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.  Bouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election {{ Algerian presidential election, 2004 }} after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation.  The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation.  It also included a second amnesty initiative, the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which was approved in a referendum in September 2005 {{ Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005 }} .  It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.  In November 2008, the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents.  This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 presidential elections {{ Algerian presidential election, 2009 }} , and he was re-elected in April 2009.  During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.  A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa {{ Arab Spring }} .  On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algerias 19-year-old state of emergency.  The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.  In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.  However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.
Climate and hydrology
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round.  After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly.  Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded. Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east.  Precipitation {{ Precipitation (meteorology) }} is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as in some years. Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful.  Algeria also has ergs {{ erg (landform) }} , or sand dunes, between mountains.  Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to .
Fauna and flora
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal, mountainous and grassy desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife.  Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization.  The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars, jackals, and gazelles, although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs (foxes), and jerboas.  Algeria also has a small African leopard and Saharan cheetah population, but these are seldom seen.  A species of deer, the Barbary stag, inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas. A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers.  The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals.  Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey.  Snakes, monitor lizards, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria.  Many animals are now extinct, including the Barbary lions, Atlas bears and crocodile {{ West African crocodile }} s.  In the north, some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub, olive trees {{ Olive }} , oaks, cedars {{ cedrus }} and other conifers {{ Pinophyta }} .  The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens (Aleppo pine, juniper, and evergreen oak) and some deciduous trees.  Fig {{ Ficus }} , eucalyptus, agave, and various palm trees {{ Arecaceae }} grow in the warmer areas.  The grape vine is indigenous to the coast.  In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees.  Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the Sahara. Camels are used extensively; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes, scorpions, and numerous insects.
Foreign relations
Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.  Algeria is included in the European Unions European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014.  It has a budget of €15. 4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes. In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria.  Defense Minister Herve Morin stated that “It’s time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,? when presenting the draft law on the payouts.  Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.
Military
The military of Algeria consists of the Peoples National Army (ANP), the Algerian National Navy (MRA), and the Algerian Air Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defence Forces.  It is the direct successor of the National Liberation Army {{ National Liberation Army (Algeria) }} (Armée de Libération Nationale or ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation {{ military occupation }} during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).  Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 12 months.  The military expenditure was 4. 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.  Algeria has the second largest military {{ List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel }} in North Africa with the largest defence budget in Africa ($10 billion).  In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1. 9 nbsp;billion.  Russia is also building two 636-type {{ Kilo class submarine }} diesel submarines for Algeria.
Hydrocarbons
Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an OPEC member since 1969.  Its crude oil production stands at around 1. 1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.  Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings.  Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas {{ List of countries by natural gas proven reserves }} in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter {{ List of countries by natural gas exports }} .  The U. S.  Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had of proven natural-gas reserves {{ natural gas reserves }} .  It also ranks 16th in oil reserves {{ List of countries by proven oil reserves }} .  Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%.  To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries.  High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.  Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.  Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43. 2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011.  Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962, and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71. 4 billion.  The Algerian national oil company is Sonatrach, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria.  All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.
Research and Alternative Energy Sources
Algeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers.  This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power.  Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R’Mel.  Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000.  Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.
Labour market
Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high.  Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21. 5% among the 15–24 age group.  The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21. 5% for those aged between 15 and 24.  The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif dAide à lInsertion Professionnelle).
Tourism
The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built. There are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qala of Beni Hammad, the first capital of the Hammadid empire; Tipasa, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and Djémila and Timgad, both Roman {{ Ancient Rome }} ruins; MZab Valley, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis; also the Casbah of Algiers is an important citadel.  The only natural World Heritage Sites is the Tassili nAjjer, a mountain range.
Transport
The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at 180,000 nbsp;km of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%.  This network will be complemented by the East-West Highway {{ Algeria East–West Highway }} , a major infrastructure project currently under construction.  It is a 3-way, 1,216 nbsp;km long highway, linking Annaba in the extreme east to the Tlemcen in the far west.  Algeria is also crossed by the Trans-Sahara Highway, which is now completely paved.  This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Tunisia.
Water supply and sanitation
There is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers, thanks to the countrys substantial oil and gas revenues.  In 2011 the capital Algiers transformed its intermittent water supply into a to continuous one, along with considerable improvements in wastewater treatment.  However, there is still poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply.  Another challenge is the pollution of water resources.
Ethnic groups
Indigenous Berbers as well as Phoenicians, Romans {{ Ancient Rome }} , Byzantines {{ Byzantine Greeks }} , Arabs {{ Arab people }} , Turks {{ Turkish people }} , various Sub-Saharan Africans, and French {{ French people }} have contributed to the history of Algeria.  Descendants of Andalusian {{ Al-Andalus }} refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities.  Moreover, Spanish {{ Spanish language }} was spoken by these Aragonese and Castillian {{ Castilian people }} Morisco {{ Moriscos }} descendants deep into the 18th century, and even Catalan {{ Catalan language }} was spoken at the same time by Catalan {{ Catalonia }} Morisco {{ Moriscos }} descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued.   There are 600,000 to 2 million former Algerian Turks {{ Turks in Algeria }} , descendants of Turkish rulers, soldiers, doctors and others who ruled the region during the Ottoman {{ Ottoman Empire }} rule in North Africa.  Todays Turkish {{ Turkish people }} descendants are often called Kouloughlis, meaning descendants of Turkish men and native Algerian women.  Despite the dominance of the Berber culture and ethnicity in Algeria, the majority of Algerians identify with an Arabic-based identity, especially after the Arab nationalism rising in the 20th century.  Berbers and Berber-speaking Algerians are divided into many groups with varying languages.  The largest of these are the Kabyles, who live in the Kabylie region east of Algiers, the Chaoui of Northeast Algeria, the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the Shenwa people {{ Chenouas }} of North Algeria.  During the colonial period, there was a large (10% in 1960) European {{ Ethnic groups in Europe }} population who became known as Pied-Noirs.  They were primarily of French, Spanish {{ Spanish people }} and Italian {{ Italian people }} origin.  Almost all of this population left during the war of independence or immediately after its end.
Languages
Berber {{ Berber language }} and Modern Standard Arabic are the official languages.  Algerian Arabic (Darja) is the language used by the majority of the population.  Colloquial Algerian Arabic is heavily infused with borrowings from French and Berber. Berber {{ Berber language }} has been recognized as a "national language" by the constitutional amendment of 8 May 2002.

The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.   Hugh Akston is identified as "One of the last great advocates of reason. " He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco dAnconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld.  He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three.  Akstons name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked.  She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century.  He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job.  When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental.  He is based on Aristotle.  Jeff Allen is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagnys cross-country trips.  Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest.

Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny.  She eventually commits suicide, unable to live with her worthless husband, and unable to escape.  Millie Bush was "a mean, ugly little eight-year-old" girl voted to receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the Marxist "family" committee who determined how pay was allocated at The Twentieth Century Motor Company.  Her teeth are later knocked out by a man denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he valued.  Emma Chalmers, Kip Chalmers mother, gains some influence after his death.  Known as "Kips Ma," she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest.  As a result, the years wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.  Kip Chalmers is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California.  On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine.  His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel.  The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.  Dan Conway is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad.  Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows.  When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of Colorado, he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.  Ken Danagger owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania.  He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galts strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.  Quentin Daniels is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galts motor.  Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had.  Dagnys pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galts Gulch.  Sebastian dAnconia was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the dAnconia dynasty.  Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the Inquisition, leaving behind a palace and his beloved.  Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace).  Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years.  He is the role model which Francisco dAnconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart.  Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.  Balph Eubank is called "the literary leader of the age", despite the fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies.  He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to 10,000 copies.  He is a misogynist who thinks it disgusting that Dagny Taggart is a railroad vice-president.  The Fishwife is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond’s grocery market; she is described as having "dark, disheveled hair and large eyes", and is a writer.  Galt says she "wouldnt be published outside.  She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.

Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer.  At age 24, his opera Phaethon was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it.  After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard.  The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared.  It is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galts Gulch.

Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galts Gulch.  Gilbert Keith-Worthing is a British novelist of erstwhile fame, now neglected but still considered a "walking classic".  Rand introduces him only for a few pages as a guest of Kip Chalmers ("for no reason that either of them could discover") to then implicitly have him asphyxiated in the Tunnel catastrophe, after giving some statements.  Fred Kinnan is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal.  Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose.  Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators.  At the end of Galts three-hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means.  Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.  Paul Larkin is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family.  He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down.  James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.

She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galts Gulch.  Cuffy Meigs is the Director of Unification for the railroad business.  He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbits foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as "impervious to thought".

His fellow looters consider it unlikely that he will survive.  Horace Bussby Mowen is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc.  of Connecticut.  He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society.  Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal.  He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract.  When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.  Midas Mulligan is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant.  When the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galts strike.  He is the legal owner of the land where Galts Gulch is located.  Mulligans birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him "Midas" in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.  Judge Narragansett is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant.  When Narragansetts ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike.

Ben Nealy is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal.  Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country.  Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power.  He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement.  He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.  Ted Nielsen is the head of Nielsen Motors.  He eventually goes on strike, along with most of the other industrialist "producer" types, by closing his motor factory.  Dagny later finds him when she visits Galts Gulch for the first time.  Betty Pope is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart.  She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.  Dr.  Potter holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute.  He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.  Dr.  Simon Pritchett is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age.  He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.  Reardens mother, whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia.  She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can.  She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.  Philip Rearden is the younger brother of Hank Rearden.  He lives in his brothers home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him.  He is resentful of his brothers charity.  Dwight Sanders owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.  Bertram Scudder is an editorial writer for the magazine The Future.  He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation.  He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called The Octopus.  He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.  Scudder claims that the most important thing in life is "brother love" but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him.  He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.  Claude Slagenhop is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Reardens friends.  He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action.  Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.  Gerald and Ivy Starnes are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes, the founder of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.  Together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into bankruptcy.  Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a pseudo-Buddhist {{ New Age }} ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their fathers company was entirely due to the workers.  Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved.  He committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man.  Gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish parties using company funds.  Ivy, on the other hand, is described as a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no desire for wealth of her own.  Andrew Stockton runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado.  When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galts Gulch.  Nathaniel "Nat" Taggart was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental.  He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit.  He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country.  He never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful.  He was one of the most hated men of his time.  Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to Francisco when she is ready to join Galts strike.  It is suspected that he is modeled after James Jerome Hill, builder of the Great Northern Railroad.   Mr.  Thompson is the "Head of the State {{ Head of State }} " for the United States.  He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look.  He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals.  Rands notes indicate that she modeled him on President Harry S.  Truman, and that she deliberately decided not to call him "President of the United States" as this title has "honorable connotations" which the character does not deserve.  Lester Tuck is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.  Clem Weatherby is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental.  Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains.  She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.  The Wet Nurse (Tony) is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills.  Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers.  He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.  Ellis Wyatt is the head of Wyatt Oil.  He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells.  When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brothers policies which directly threaten his business.  When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: "I am leaving it as I found it.  Take over.  Its yours. " One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as "Wyatts Torch".  Later Dagny meets him in Galts Gulch.

Dagny Taggart

Francisco dAnconia
Francisco dAnconia is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged, an owner by inheritance of the worlds largest copper mining operation.  He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart.  A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the "climax" of the dAnconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists.  He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler.  He began working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his familys wealth and power.  Later, Francisco bankrupts the dAnconia business to put it out of others reach.  His full name is given as "Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián dAnconia".
John Galt
John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged.

Only Eddies side of their conversations is given in the novel.  Later in the novel, the reader discovers this workers true identity. Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment.  This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden.  Galt himself remains concealed, throughout much of the novel, in a valley concealed by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership.  Much of the books third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the authors philosophy of Objectivism.

Rearden represents a type of self-made man or prototypical hero, and illustrates Rands theory of sex {{ Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex }} in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to Dagny Taggart.  Although this is not stated in the book.
Eddie Willers

Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galts associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations.  After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.
Ragnar Danneskjöld
One of Galts first followers, and world-famous as a pirate, who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the Peoples States of Europe.  He works to ensure that once those espousing Galts philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world.  Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years.  Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired film star.  Considered a misfit by Galts other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galts perspective. According to Barbara Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjölds adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.  In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjölds name was a tribute to Victor Hugos novel, Hans of Iceland, wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.  In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.
James Taggart
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the books most important antagonist.  Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own.  He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs.  In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.  This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this.  In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.
Lillian Rearden
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value.  Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husbands affair with his sister.  This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others.  Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.
Dr.  Floyd Ferris
Ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the State Science Institute.  He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled Why Do You Think You Think? He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal.  He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan.  Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine.  When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt.  Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.
Dr.  Robert Stadler
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco dAnconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld.  He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free.  He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone).  The character was, in part, modeled on J.  Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons.  To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act for the good.
Wesley Mouch
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington {{ Washington, D. C.  }} , who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty.  In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.  Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.

<TEXT>Intro
Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies {{ society }} .  Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies.  Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life.  Biological or physical anthropology {{ Biological anthropology }} studies the biological development of humans. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history.
Origin and development of the term
The abstract noun anthropology {{ wiktionary:anthropology }} is first attested in reference to history.  Its present use first appeared in Renaissance {{ German Renaissance }} Germany {{ Holy Roman Empire }} in the works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann.  Their New Latin derived from the combining forms of the Greek {{ Ancient Greek }} words ánthr?pos ( }}, "human") and lógos ( }}, "study {{ science }} ").  (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of Aristotle. ) It began to be used in English, possibly via French {{ French language }} , by the early 18th century.
Fields
Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.  Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens {{ Human }} , human physical traits, human behavior, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture, and from social sciences, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.  Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.  As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, global studies, and various ethnic studies. According to Clifford Geertz,  Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist {{ structuralism }} and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies.  During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline.  During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology.  In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist.  Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.
Organizations
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges.  The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the American Anthropological Association (AAA), which was founded in 1903.  Membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.  In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe.  The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology. Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music theory, art history, sociology and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.
Controversial ethical stances
Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.  Some commentators have contended: That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.  (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf.  Lewis 2004).   That ethnographic work was often ahistorical {{ Ahistoricism }} , writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, Time and Its Other).
Post–World War II developments
Before WWII British social anthropology and American cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions.  After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology.
Through the 19th century
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the University of Copenhagen, defined as follows:  Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.   Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the National Museum of Natural History (France) by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau.  Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed.  The Société Ethnologique de Paris, the first to use Ethnology, was formed in 1839.  Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists.  When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned. Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the American Ethnological Society, was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the Ethnological Society of London in 1843, a break-away group of the Aborigines Protection Society.  These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-human-rights activists.  {{ Human rights }} They maintained international connections. Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century.  Theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy {{ comparative anatomy }} , linguistics {{ Comparative method (linguistics) }} , and Ethnology, making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.  For them, the publication of Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect.  Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild. Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s.  There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences.  Paul Broca in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the Société dAnthropologie de Paris {{ Society of Anthropology of Paris }} , meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.  When he read Darwin he became an immediate convert to Transformisme, as the French called evolutionism.  His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".  Broca, being what today would be called a neurosurgeon {{ Neurosurgery }} , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech.  He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech.  He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called Brocas area after him.  His interest was mainly in Biological anthropology, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, Theodor Waitz, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker, 1859–1864.  The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples".  The last two volumes were published posthumously. Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man".  By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath"; i. e. , he was an animist {{ Animism }} .  Following Brocas lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him".  He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.  The history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison.  It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".  Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists.  In 1863 the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt {{ James Hunt (speech therapist) }} broke away from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological Society of London, which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology.  It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence.  Representatives from the French Société were present, though not Broca.  In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, The Anthropological Review, Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.  Among the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor, inventor of cultural anthropology, and his brother Alfred Tylor, a geologist.  Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist. Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently.  The majority of these were evolutionist.  One notable exception was the Berlin Society of Anthropology {{ :de:Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte }} (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists.  Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation. During the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association.  The major theorists belonged to these organizations.  They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning.  By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology.  None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.
20th and 21st centuries
This meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions, many thousands in number.  Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more.  Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene.  Organization has reached global level.  For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.  Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology {{ cultural anthropology }} in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons {{ cross-cultural studies }} , long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on participant-observation {{ Participant observation }} or experiential immersion in the area of research.  Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.  This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas arguments {{ Boasian anthropology }} against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial {{ post-colonialism }} oppression and promotion of multiculturalism.  Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.  In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate.  In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century: biological or physical anthropology {{ Biological anthropology }} ; social {{ social anthropology }} , cultural {{ cultural anthropology }} , or sociocultural anthropology {{ sociocultural anthropology }} ; and archaeology; plus anthropological linguistics {{ linguistic anthropology }} .  These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques. European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F.  Kollár {{ Adam František Kollár }} in 1783).  It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.
Sociocultural
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology.  Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups.  Cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy, literature and the arts (how ones culture affects experience for self and group, contributing to more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history.  in that it helps develop understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc. ).  There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree. Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.  Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.  This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography.  Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i. e.  an ethnographic monograph.  As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site.  Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.  Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures.  The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic (conceptual, vs.  etic, or technical) point of view. The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal.  Sociocultural anthropology also covers economic {{ Economic anthropology }} and political organization {{ Political anthropology }} , law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology). Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.  Cultures in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) of world societies are:
Biological
Biological Anthropology and Physical Anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions.  It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.
Archaeological
Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.  Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies.  Archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices.  Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.
Linguistic
Linguistic anthropology (also called anthropological linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.  It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes.  Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics, semiotics, discourse analysis, and narrative analysis.
Historical
Ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic {{ Ethnography }} cultures and indigenous {{ Indigenous peoples }} customs by examining historical records {{ History }} .  It is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today.  Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation.  Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts.  Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.
Religion
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures.  Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human community that worships it.
Urban
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism.  Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition".  Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the "Third World" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "specialists in other cultures {{ Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures" }} " closer to their homes.  There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities.  These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other.  By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities.  By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.
Anthrozoology
Anthrozoology (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things.  It is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology.  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.  It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.
Biocultural
Biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture.  Physical anthropologists {{ Biological anthropology }} throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial {{ Race (classification of human beings) }} perspective; that is, from the assumption that typological {{ Typology (anthropology) }} human biological differences lead to cultural differences.  After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.
Evolutionary
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution {{ human evolution }} of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates.  Evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science, combining the human development {{ Human development (biology) }} with socioeconomic factors.  Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present.  It is based on a scientific approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics.  It is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.
Forensic
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition.  A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable.  The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.
Palaeoanthropology
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology.  It is the study of ancient humans, as found in fossil hominid {{ Hominidae }} evidence such as petrifacted {{ Petrifaction }} bones and footprints.

Ethics of cultural relativism
As part of their quest for scientific objectivity, present-day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.  This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms.  There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.  Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide, infanticide, racism, mutilation (including circumcision and subincision), and torture.  Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed, not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of Mans inhumanity to man.  To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.
Ethical stance to military involvement
Anthropologists involvement with the U. S.  government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline.  Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists. But by the 1940s, many of Boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the "Axis" (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan).  Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information).  At the same time, David H.  Price {{ David Price (anthropologist) }} s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies. Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little.  Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA). Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state {{ State (polity) }} .  Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings.  The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous.  The AAAs current Statement of Professional Responsibility clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments nbsp;.  no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given. "Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Armys strategy in Afghanistan.  The Christian Science Monitor reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" in Afghanistan {{ War in Afghanistan (2001–present) }} , under the Human Terrain System (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq.  In 2009, the American Anthropological Associations Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.  In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD. "
Basic trends
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work.  One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic {{ Holism }} account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.  The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard.  These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.  Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).  They use many different methods of study, but modern population genetics, participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork. " On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs. Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions.  Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology.  Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian {{ Levallois technique }} help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.  Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences.  By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.
Commonalities between fields
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of Anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting {{ Fossil collecting }} , exploring {{ Exploration }} , documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and religious studies, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.  Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).  For example, the classic of urban anthropology, Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology mentions that the "Third World" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.  Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors "home".  It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and Sociology, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.  In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like Terrain {{ Terrain (journal) }} ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by Marc Augé (Le Centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains {{ École des hautes études en sciences sociales }} , the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale.  There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.

Art
One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon.  Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of painting, sculpture, or literature, conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.  To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being artistic, have certain evident aesthetic qualities.  Boas Primitive Art, Claude Lévi-Strauss The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertzs Art as Cultural System (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics.
Media
Media anthropology (also known as anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes ethnographic studies {{ ethnography }} as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media.  The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e. g. , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.  Other types include cyber anthropology, a relatively new area of internet research, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, social movements, or health education.  This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, the press {{ newspaper }} , new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.

Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Visual
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic {{ ethnography }} photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media.  While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film, visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and reception {{ reception theory }} of mass media {{ anthropology of media }} .  Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.
Economic
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope.  It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical.  Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, Bronislaw Malinowski, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity {{ Reciprocity (cultural anthropology) }} ) as an alternative to market exchange.  Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange.  The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.  Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.
Political economy
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies.  Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture.  Three main areas of interest rapidly developed.  The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes.  Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image.  The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam.  The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.  More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.
Applied
Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.  It is a, "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".  More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.  It is closely related to Development anthropology (distinct from the more critical Anthropology of development).
Development
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective.  The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail?
Kinship
Kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves.  Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "descent {{ kinship }} ", "descent groups", "lineage {{ lineage (anthropology) }} s", "affine {{ affinity (law) }} s", "cognates {{ cognatic kinship }} ", and even "fictive kinship".  Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (ones social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.
Feminist
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology (archeological {{ archaeology }} , biological {{ biological anthropology }} , cultural {{ cultural anthropology }} , linguistic {{ linguistic anthropology }} ) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge.  Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists.  Historically, such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world.  Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory.  Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies.  Feminist anthropology is inclusive of [http://www. springerreference. com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940. html birth anthropology] as a specialization.  The first African-American female anthropologist and Caribbeanist is said to be Vera Mae Green who studied ethnic and family relations in the Caribbean as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.
Medical
Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".  It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology.  Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole.  It focuses on the following six basic fields:   the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patient-physician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007) the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness.  On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry.
Nutritional
Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems, nutritional status {{ nutrition }} and food security, and how changes in the former affect the latter.  If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization.  Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.
Psychological
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural {{ cultural anthropology }} and mental processes {{ psychology }} .  This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and mental health.  It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.
Cognitive
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural innovation, and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences (especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation {{ interpretation (logic) }} of cultural forms.  Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.
Transpersonal
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture.  As with transpersonal psychology, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and transpersonal experience.  However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of myth {{ Mythology }} , ritual, diet {{ diet (nutrition) }} , and texts {{ Literature }} in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.
Political
Political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems {{ Form of government }} , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies.  Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena.  The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels.  First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization).  Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions).  An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today.  Geertz comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state is an early, famous example.
Legal
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".  Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  More recent applications include issues such as human rights, legal pluralism, and political uprisings.
Public
Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change" ([http://www. publicanthropology. org Borofsky 2004]).
Cyborg
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Associations annual meeting in 1993.  The sub-group was very closely related to STS {{ science and technology studies }} and the Society for the Social Studies of Science.  Donna Haraways 1985 Cyborg Manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term.  Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.
Digital
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect.  It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology {{ cultural anthropology }} , and sometimes considered part of material culture.  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases.  These include techno-anthropology, digital ethnography, cyberanthropology, and virtual anthropology.
Ecological
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of cultural adaptations to environments".  The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment".  The focus of its research concerns "how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems. "
Environmental
Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.  The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology.  Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.  The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land.  Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies).  Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.

<TEXT>Intro
Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture.  (Veterinary science {{ veterinary medicine }} , but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition. )
Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy
The three terms are often confused.  However, they cover different concepts: Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use.  Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.  Agronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based crops. Agricultural sciences include research and development on: Production techniques (e. g. , irrigation management, recommended nitrogen inputs) Improving agricultural productivity in terms of quantity and quality (e. g. , selection of drought-resistant crops and animals, development of new pesticides, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro cell culture techniques) Minimizing the effects of pests (weeds, insects, pathogens, nematodes) on crop or animal production systems.  Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e. g. , production, preservation, and packaging of dairy products) Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e. g. , soil degradation {{ soil retrogression and degradation }} , waste management, bioremediation) Theoretical production ecology, relating to crop production modeling Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed subsistence agriculture, which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture, which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.  Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the USA and the EU.  Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e. g.  soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e. g.  crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e. g.  ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.
Fertilizer
One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crops C to N ratio and the local environment
A local science
With the exception of theoretical agronomy {{ theoretical production ecology }} , research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas.  It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another.  Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally.  Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.
History of agricultural science
Agricultural science began with Gregor Mendels genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological {{ plant physiology }} understanding in 18th-century Germany.  In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term "agricultural science".  The Hatch Act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer.  The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.  After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.  Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries {{ Developing country }} , often referred to as the Green Revolution, was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary product {{ pesticide }} s. As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture, industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields.  These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as integrated pest management, waste treatment {{ waste management }} technologies, landscape architecture, genomics, and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production {{ food industry }} as something essentially different from non-essential economic goods.  In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science. New technologies, such as biotechnology and computer science (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including genetic engineering, agrophysics, improved statistical analysis {{ statistics }} , and precision farming.  Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of traditional agriculture {{ history of agriculture }} , including interaction of religion and agriculture {{ Religion and Agriculture }} , and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

Agricultural science and agriculture crisis
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the worlds population while preventing biosafety problems that may affect human health and the environment {{ environment (biophysical) }} .  This requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system. Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate.  Recent crises (such as avian influenza, mad cow disease {{ Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy }} and issues such as the use of genetically modified organisms) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

<TEXT>Intro
Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific {{ protoscience }} tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia.  It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects.  }} Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation {{ transmutation of elements }} of "base metals" (e. g. , lead) into "noble {{ noble metal }} " ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas {{ panacea (medicine) }} able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent.  The perfection of the human body {{ human body }} and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus {{ Magnum opus (alchemy) }} and, in the Hellenistic {{ Hellenistic period }} and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis.  In Europe, the creation of a philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects. In English, the term is often limited to descriptions of European alchemy, but similar practices existed in the Far East {{ Chinese alchemy }} , the Indian subcontinent {{ Rasayana }} , and the Muslim world {{ Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam }} .  In Europe, following the 12th-century Renaissance produced by the translation of Islamic works on science {{ Islamic science }} and the Recovery of Aristotle, alchemists {{ list of alchemists }} played a significant role in early modern {{ early modern era }} science (particularly chemistry {{ history of chemistry }} and medicine {{ history of medicine }} ).  Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques, theory, terminology, and experimental method, some of which are still in use today.  However, they continued antiquity {{ classical antiquity }} s belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers {{ history of cryptography }} and cryptic symbolism.  Their work was guided by Hermetic principles {{ Hermeticism }} related to magic {{ Magic (paranormal) }} , mythology, and religion.  Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects, despite the arguments of scholars like Holmyard {{ Eric John Holmyard }} and von Franz {{ Marie-Louise von Franz }} that they should be understood as complementary.  The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences {{ history of the physical sciences }} who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry {{ history of chemistry }} , medicine {{ history of medicine }} , and charlatanism, and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred.  The latter interests historians of esotericism, psychologists {{ history of psychology }} , and some philosophers and spiritualists {{ spirituality }} .  The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.  Despite this split, which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions origin in a mix of Greek philosophy that was mixed with Egyptian {{ Ancient Egyptian technology }} and Mesopotamian technology {{ Mesopotamian science }} , numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as Pseudo-Democrituss first-century nbsp; On Physical and Mystical Matters ( ).
Name
The word alchemy was borrowed from Old French alquemie, alkimie, taken from Medieval Latin alchymia, and which is in turn borrowed from Arabic al-kīmiy?’ ( ).  The Arabic word is borrowed from Late Greek chēmeía (χημεία), chēmía (χημία), with the agglutination of the Arabic definite article al- ( ).  This ancient Greek word was derived from the early Greek name for Egypt, Chēmia (Χημία), based on the Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }} name for Egypt, kēme (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓??𓊖 khmi, lit.  ‘black earth’, as opposed to red desert sand).  The Medieval Latin form was influenced by Greek chymeia (χυμεία) meaning ‘mixture’ and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry.
History
Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.  These traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships.  One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: Chinese alchemy, centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; Indian alchemy {{ Rasayana }} , centered on the Indian subcontinent; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the Mediterranean {{ Mediterranean Basin }} and whose center has shifted over the millennia from Greco-Roman Egypt {{ Egypt (Roman province) }} , to the Islamic world {{ Muslim world }} , and finally medieval Europe {{ Middle Ages }} .  Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism and Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths {{ Indian religions }} , whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various Western religions.  It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.
Core concepts
Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born.  Concepts were imported from Neoplatonism and earlier Greek cosmology.  As such, the Classical elements appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven Classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity.  Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature.  The concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone.
Modern alchemy
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.  Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M.  Principe and William R.  Newman, have interpreted the decknamen (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances.  These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts. Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements.  Groups like the Rosicrucians {{ Rosicrucianism }} and Freemasons {{ Freemasonry }} have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism.  Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, "occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances. ", which has contributed to a merger of magic {{ magic (paranormal) }} and alchemy in popular thought.

Hellenistic Egypt
The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt, where the city of Alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.  Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and Hellenistic philosophy, each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West.  Zosimos of Panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy, while Mary the Jewess is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist.  They wrote in Greek {{ Greek language }} and lived in Egypt under Roman {{ Roman Empire }} rule. Mythology – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt {{ Ancient Egypt }} where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.  Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.  These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, Isis, Osiris, Jason, and many others. The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is Hermes Trismegistus (or Thrice-Great Hermes).  His name is derived from the god {{ deity }} Thoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes.  Hermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff, were among alchemys principal symbols.  According to Clement of Alexandria, he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of Hermes", covering all fields of knowledge.  The Hermetica of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the hermetic philosophy {{ hermeticism }} by its early practitioners.  These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era. Technology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy, extending back to 3500 nbsp; .  Many writings were lost when the emperor {{ Roman Emperor }} Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ( nbsp;292).  Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X.  Dating from nbsp;300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.  These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements.  Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.  Philosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character.  An important example of alchemys roots in Greek philosophy, originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: earth {{ Earth (classical element) }} , air {{ Air (classical element) }} , water {{ Water (classical element) }} , and fire {{ Fire (classical element) }} .  According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.  The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; ". True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word.  The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form. " Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept. Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity.  Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth.  St nbsp;Augustine {{ Augustine of Hippo }} later affirmed this in the 4th 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.  Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period. Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as Moses {{ Moses of Alexandria }} , Isis, Cleopatra {{ Cleopatra the Alchemist }} , Democritus {{ Pseudo-Democritus }} , and Ostanes.  Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we only know through fragments of text.  After nbsp;400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.  By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.  It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.

The Vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold.  The use of Mercury {{ Mercury (element) }} for alchemy is first documented in the 3rd– or 4th–century Arthashastra.  Buddhist {{ Buddhism }} texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold.  Greek alchemy may have been introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of Alexander the Great in 325 nbsp; , and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like Gandh?ra, although hard evidence for this is lacking.  The 11th-century Persian chemist {{ Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam }} and physician {{ Medicine in medieval Islam }} Abū Rayh?n Bīrūnī, who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni, reported that they The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit divya-deham) and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit jīvan-mukti).  Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī. Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath.  Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise Kaly?ṇak?rakam of Ugr?ditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.  Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were N?g?rjuna Siddha {{ Nagarjuna (metallurgist) }} and Nityan?tha Siddha.  N?g?rjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk.  His book, Rasendramangalam, is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine.  Nityan?tha Siddha wrote Rasaratn?kara, also a highly influential work.  In Sanskrit, rasa translates to "mercury", and N?g?rjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.  Reliable scholarship on Indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of The Alchemical Body by David Gordon White.  Trustworthy scholarship on Indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account. An important modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has also been provided by David Gordon White at [http://www. oxfordbibliographies. com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0046. xml?rskey=skoSqW result=1 q=rasayana#firstMatch Oxford Bibliographies Online].  The contents of 39 Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in G.  Jan Meulenbelds History of Indian Medical Literature.  The discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each work, their special features, and where possible the evidence concerning their dating.  Chapter 13 of HIML, Various works on rasaś?stra and ratnaś?stra (or Various works on alchemy and gems) gives brief details of a further 655 (six hundred and fifty-five) treatises.  In some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles. A great deal remains to be discovered about Indian alchemical literature.  The content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet (2014) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy.
Muslim world
After the fall of the Roman Empire {{ The fall of the roman empire }} , the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World.  Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.  The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word al-kīmiy?’ (الكيمياء).  The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy.  Platonic and Aristotelian {{ Aristotle }} thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac {{ Syriac language }} translations and scholarship. In the late 8th century, J?bir ibn Hayy?n (Latinized as "Geber" or "Geberus") introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.  Jabir is thus "considered by many to be the father of chemistry", albeit others reserve that title for Robert Boyle or Antoine Lavoisier.  The science historian, Paul Kraus, wrote: Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation: Early Islamic chemists such as Jabir Ibn Hayyan {{ J?bir ibn Hayy?n }} , Al-Kindi ("Alkindus") and Muhammad ibn Zakarīya R?zi ("Rasis" or "Rhazes") contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic (hydrochloric acid), sulfuric {{ sulfuric acid }} and nitric acids, and more.  The discovery that aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium. Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.  The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir.  Jabirs ultimate goal was Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life.  He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness, coldness, dryness, and moistness.  According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior.  For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist.  Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.  By this reasoning, the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to Western alchemy.  Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the elements physical properties. The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir.  His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five classical elements (aether {{ aether (classical element) }} , air {{ Air (classical element) }} , earth {{ Earth (classical element) }} , fire {{ Fire (classical element) }} , and water {{ Water (classical element) }} ) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals: sulphur {{ Sulfur }} , "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and mercury {{ Mercury (element) }} , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.  Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and salt {{ Salt (chemistry) }} giving solidity.  The atomic theory of corpuscularianism, where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.  From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including Alkindus {{ Al-Kindi }} , Abū al-Rayh?n al-Bīrūnī, Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun.  In particular, they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals {{ Philosophers stone }} .
East Asia
Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.  The philosophers stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality {{ Elixir of life }} sought by Chinese alchemists.  However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears. Black powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists.  As previously stated above, Chinese {{ China }} alchemy was more related to medicine.  It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life.  Described in 9th-century texts and used in fireworks in China by the 10th century , it was used in cannons by 1290 .  From China, the use of gunpowder spread to Japan, the Mongols, the Muslim world, and Europe.  Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and to martial arts such as Tai Chi Chuan {{ Tai chi chuan }} and Kung Fu (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical).  In fact, in the early Song dynasty, followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest mercuric sulfide {{ cinnabar }} , which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide .  Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan , mastering of the qi , etc. ).
Medieval Europe
The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of Robert of Chesters translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy.  Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing.  The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath.  Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and al-Razi.  These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent.  Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.  Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought.  The 11th-century St nbsp;Anselm {{ Anselm of Canterbury }} put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.  In the early 12th century, Peter Abelard followed Anselms work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West.  In the early 13th century, Robert Grosseteste used Abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations.  Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.  Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made.  The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists.  In the 13th century, Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.  Albertus Magnus, a Dominican monk {{ Dominican Order }} , is known to have written works such as the Book of Minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time.  Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals.  From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.  Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Alberts student Thomas Aquinas. Roger Bacon, a Franciscan monk {{ Franciscan Order }} who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics, comparative linguistics, and medicine, composed his Great Work {{ Opus Majus }} ( ) for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time.  While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and Christian theology.  Bacons writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life.  His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.  Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres.  He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time.  The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.  In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage.  In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions. Soon after Bacon, the influential work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared.  His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods.  It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.  By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief.  Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul {{ soul }} ).  They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated.  Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories {{ theory }} about how the universe operated.  Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam.  By purifying the two parts of mans soul, man could be reunited with God.  In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars.  Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.  Dante, Piers Plowman, and Chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars.  Pope John XXIIs 1317 edict, Spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists.  In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV ).  These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone.  The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus, John of Rupescissa, and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.  Nicolas Flamel is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous.  Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.  Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosophers stone.  His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations.  Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosophers stone.  Through the 14th and 15th centuries {{ late Middle Ages }} , alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone.  Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley {{ George Ripley (alchemist) }} made similar contributions.  Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.
Renaissance and early modern Europe
During the Renaissance, Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy.  The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed. In the late 15th century, Marsilo Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin.  These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent.  Renaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel. Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.  A key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists.  In his De Occulta Philosophia, he attempted to merge Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and alchemy.  He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.  Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia.  Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, "Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver.  For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines. " His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm.  He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.  Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning to separate and to join together, based on the Latin alchemic maxim: solve et coagula).  Iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus. John Dee (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippas occult tradition.  Though better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as astrologer, cryptographer, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I {{ Elizabeth I of England }} , Dees alchemical Monas Hieroglyphica, written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work.  His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom As above so below.  During the 17th century, a short-lived "supernatural" interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the Royal Society: Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole.  Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.  Entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe.  Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.  Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley.  King James IV of Scotland {{ James IV of Scotland }} , Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists.  Johns son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book Fasciculus Chemicus.  Though most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance.  Betrüger would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage.  Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the con artists.  False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud. The terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day.  There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic.  For example, Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations, had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute.  Michael Sendivogius {{ Michał Sędziwój }} (Michał Sędziwój, 1566–1636), a Polish {{ Poland }} alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600.  Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine.  Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see Isaac Newtons occult studies) than he did to either optics or physics.  Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include Robert Boyle, and Jan Baptist van Helmont.  Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.
Late modern period
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom".  Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century.  As late as 1781 James Price {{ James Price (chemist) }} claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold.  Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: "Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof. " Robert Boyle (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations.  He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data.  Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.  This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier {{ Antoine Lavoisier }} and John Dalton. Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction was drawn between "alchemy" and "chemistry" for the first time.  By the 1740s, "alchemy" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.  In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to separate and divorce the "new" chemistry from the "old" practices of alchemy.  This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.  During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.  The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.  This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.  In the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock {{ Ethan A.  Hitchcock (general) }} , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy.  Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy. " Atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner.  Hitchcock, in his Remarks Upon Alchymists (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state.  In 1845, Baron Carl Reichenbach, published his studies on Odic force, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.
Women in alchemy
Several women figure in the earliest history of alchemy.  Michael Maier names Mary the Jewess, Cleopatra the Alchemist, Medera, and Taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosophers stone.  Zosimos sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and Isis the Prophetess also play a role in the early alchemical texts. The first alchemist is recognized as being Mary the Jewess (c.  200 A. D. ).  Mary is known for a number of improvements on alchemy equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry.  Her most well-known advancements are heating and distillation processes.  The water-bath, also known as bain-marie is said to have been invented by or at least improved by her.  This double-boiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating.  The tribikos (a basic still) and the kerotakis (a more intricate distilling apparatus) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her.  While these were great achievements, Mary the Jewess most critical contribution is considered to be the identification of hydrochloric acid, a frequently used chemical today.  Though we have no writing from Maria herself, she is known from the fourth century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis.  Due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women.  After the Greco-Roman period, womens names appear less frequently the alchemical literature.  Women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods, aside from the fictitious account of Perenelle Flamel.  Mary Anne Atwoods A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery (1850) marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival.
Modern historical research
The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.  As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and philosophy, the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, kabbalism {{ Kabbalah }} , spiritualism, Rosicrucianism, and other mystic movements.  Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University, the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (ESSWE), and the University of Amsterdams Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents.  A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam.  A recipe found in a mid 19th century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold.  The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.  Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include Ambix, published by the Society for the History of alchemy and Chemistry, and Isis {{ Isis (journal) }} , published by The History of Science Society.
Hermeticism
In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and Hermetic {{ Hermeticism }} practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual.  Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.  The writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus are a primary source of alchemical theory.  He is named "alchemys founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide".  Early alchemists, such as Zosimos of Panopolis (c.  AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.  This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation.  In this sense, the literal meanings of Alchemical Formulas were a blind, hiding their true spiritual philosophy.  Practitioners and patrons such as Melchior Cibinensis and Pope Innocent VIII existed within the ranks of the church, while Martin Luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.  Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible.  Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal.  In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic alchemical symbols, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning. In his 1766 Alchemical Catechism, Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:
Magnum opus
The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.  nigredo, a blackening or melanosis albedo {{ Albedo (alchemy) }} , a whitening or leucosis citrinitas, a yellowing or xanthosis rubedo, a reddening, purpling, or iosis
Traditional medicine
Traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques.  In Ayurveda, the samskaras {{ Samskara (Ayurvedic) }} are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity.  These processes are actively used to the present day.  Spagyrists of the 20th century, Albert Richard Riedel {{ Frater Albertus }} and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods.  The schools they founded, Les Philosophes de la Nature and The Paracelsus Research Society, popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.  The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.
Psychology
Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung {{ Carl Jung }} .  Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of The Secret of the Golden Flower, a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the internal or psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients.  He called the creation of the gold or lapis within the process of "individuation. " Together with his alchemical mystica soror, Jungian Swiss analyst Marie-Louise von Franz, Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available and pored over them.  The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage.  His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces (archetypes {{ Jungian archetypes }} ) that influence all of life. Both von Franz and Jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture.  Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, Mysterium Conuinctionis {{ Mysterium Coniunctionis }} .
Literature
Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment.  Literary alchemy appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare {{ William Shakespeare }} to J.  K.  Rowling.  Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus.  In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett. Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy.  While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work.  Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers.  In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

<TEXT>Intro
An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth.  They look at stars, planets, moons {{ Natural satellite }} , comets and galaxies {{ Galaxy }} , as well as many other celestial objects — either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy.  Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies.  There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. Astronomers usually fit into two types:Observational astronomers make direct observations of planets, stars and galaxies, and analyze the data. Theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed.  Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers have to observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve and die.  They use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work.  There are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy, galactic astronomy or physical cosmology.

Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "astronomer" and "astrophysicist" are interchangeable.  Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a Ph. D.  {{ Doctor of Philosophy }} in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.  They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory. The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small.  The American Astronomical Society, which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,000 members.  This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.  The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the Ph. D.  level and beyond.  right {{ Image:Br Guy in Lab. jpg }} Vatican Observatory, analyzing a meteorite, 2014]]Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time.  Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation.  Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year.  Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers time. Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes.  Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field. Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school.  Taking courses that teach how to research, write and present papers are also invaluable.  In college/university most astronomers get a Ph. D.  in astronomy or physics.  Keeping in mind how few astronomers there are it is understood that graduate schools in this field are very competitive, so grades are very important.  Students must take a Graduate Record Exam in the United States if they wish to be accepted into a US graduate school.
Amateur astronomers
right {{ Image:Emily_Lakdawalla_at_FameLab_at_LPSC_2013. jpg }} at the Planetary Conference 2013]]While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among amateurs.  Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties {{ star party }} .  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.  Like any hobby, most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research.  However, amateurs span the range from so-called "armchair astronomers" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

<TEXT>Intro
ASCII ( ), abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII ).  ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices.  Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.
Overview
ASCII was developed from telegraph code.  Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services.  Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the American Standards Associations (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3. 2 subcommittee.  The first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and experienced its most recent update during 1986.  Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i. e. , alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters. Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters {{ character (computing) }} into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above.  The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, basic punctuation symbols, control codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a space {{ space (punctuation) }} .  For example, lowercase j would become binary {{ binary number }} 1101010 and decimal 106.  ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space {{ space (punctuation) }} (which is considered an invisible graphic ). A June 1992 RFC and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority registry of character sets recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet: ANSI_X3. 4-1968 (canonical name), iso-ir-6, ANSI_X3. 4-1986, ISO_646. irv:1991, ASCII, ISO646-US, US-ASCII (preferred MIME name), us, IBM367, cp367, and csASCII. Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name "US-ASCII" for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a redundant acronym {{ RAS syndrome }} , but the US is needed because of regular confusion of the ASCII term with other 8 bit based character encoding schemes such as Extended ASCII or UTF-8 for example).  One often finds this in the optional "charset" parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent "meta" element of some HTML documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some XML documents.
History
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3. 2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittees X3. 2. 4 working group (now INCITS).  The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI) and ultimately the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3. 4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.  There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.  The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks The 128 characters of the 7-bit ASCII character set are divided into eight 16-character groups called sticks 0–7, associated with the three most-significant bits.  Depending on the horizontal or vertical representation of the character map, sticks correspond with either table rows or columns. }} 6 and 7, and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.  The X3. 2. 4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.  Locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers. The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the brace {{ bracket }} and vertical bar characters), renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).  ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3. 4-1967, then USAS X3. 4-1968, ANSI X3. 4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3. 4-1986.  Revisions of the ASCII standard: ASA X3. 4-1963  ASA X3. 4-1965 (approved, but not published, nevertheless used by IBM 2260 2265 {{ IBM 2265 }} Display Stations and IBM 2848 Display Control)  USAS X3. 4-1967  USAS X3. 4-1968  ANSI X3. 4-1977  ANSI X3. 4-1986  ANSI X3. 4-1986 (R1992) ANSI X3. 4-1986 (R1997) ANSI INCITS 4-1986 (R2002)  ANSI INCITS 4-1986 (R2007)  ANSI INCITS 4-1986 (R2012)In the X3. 15 standard, the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (least significant bit first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape.  They proposed a 9-track standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some punched card formats.
Use
ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone Telegraphs TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network.  TWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2, which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system.  Bob Bemer {{ Robert William Bemer }} introduced features such as the escape sequence {{ Escape character }} .  His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer, "so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe".  Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called "the father of ASCII".   On March 11, 1968, U. S.  President Lyndon B.  Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:  I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations. All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.  ASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007, when UTF-8 encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII.
Variants and derivations
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies {{ Standardization }} and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets.  One could class some of these variations as "ASCII extensions", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCIIs character-map in the 7-bit range.  Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.
Bit width
The X3. 2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems.  Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character {{ character (computing) }} symbols (i. e.  graphemes and control characters).  This allows digital {{ Digital data }} devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language.  Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic {{ English alphabet }} characters, 10 numerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.  To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique {{ CCITT }} (CCITT) International Telegraph Alphabet No.  2 (ITA2) standard of 1924, FIELDATA (1956 ), and early EBCDIC (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII. ITA2 were in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code Émile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.  The committee debated the possibility of a shift {{ Shift code }} function (like in ITA2), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code {{ six-bit character code }} .  In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.  It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission, as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable.  The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.  The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits (octet {{ octet (computing) }} s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal.  However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice.  The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission.  Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired.  Eight-bit machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.  In some printers, the high bit was used to enable Italics printing.
Internal organization
The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.  The first two so called ASCII sticks (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.  The "space" character {{ Space (punctuation) }} had to come before graphics to make sorting {{ sorting algorithm }} easier, so it became position 20 hex {{ hexadecimal }} ; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support uppercase {{ upper case }} 64-character alphabets {{ sixbit code pages }} , and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes, as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code (1963).  Lowercase {{ Lower case }} letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase.  To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter A was placed in position 41 hex {{ hexadecimal }} to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.  The digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining 4 bits {{ Nibble }} correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward. Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters, not electric typewriters.  Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No.  2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were "#$%_ () early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common.  Thus, in ASCII !"#$% were placed in the second stick, positions 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick.  The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character.  This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9.  This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters.  Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did.  The /? pair also dates to the No.  2, and the , lt; .  gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No.  2, did not shift , (comma) or .  (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting).  However, ASCII split the ;: pair (dating to No.  2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly - =+ ) to : ;+ -= . Some common characters were not included, notably ½¼¢ , while ^`~ were included as diacritics for international use, and lt; gt; for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters \| (in addition to common / ).  The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 40 hex {{ hexadecimal }} , right before the letter A.  The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), end of message {{ End of Message }} (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), "who are you?" (WRU), "are you?" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK).  These were positioned to maximize the Hamming distance between their bit patterns.
Character order
ASCII-code order is also called ASCIIbetical order.  Collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order (collating sequence).  The main deviations in ASCII order are: All uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, "Z" precedes "a" Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters; for example, "4" precedes "one" Numbers are sorted naïvely as strings; for example, "10" precedes "2"An intermediate order readily implemented converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.  Naïve number sorting can be averted by zero-filling {{ Leading zero }} all numbers (e. g.  "02" will sort before "10" as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.
Control characters
ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for control characters: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers {{ computer printer }} ) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information {{ Metadata }} about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. For example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace".  RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or white space {{ Whitespace (computer science) }} as non-whitespace control characters.  Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document.  Other schemes, such as markup languages, address page and document layout and formatting. The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character.  The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream, and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of "delete". Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape {{ punched tape }} reader/punch option.  Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape.  In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete {{ Delete key }} ) became de facto standards.  The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected. When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique.  On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.  Code 127 is officially named "delete" but the Teletype label was "rubout".  Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied.  The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes).  This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.  Tapes designed to be "hand edited" could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be "rubbed out" and then replacements put into the empty space. Some software assigned special meanings to ASCII characters sent to the software from the terminal.  Operating systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, for example, interpreted DEL as an input character as meaning "remove previously-typed input character", and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems.  Most other systems used BS for that meaning and used DEL to mean "remove the character at the cursor".  That latter interpretation is the most common now.  Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones.  The "escape" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning.  This is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in URL encodings, C language {{ C (programming language) }} strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning.  Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed.  In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called "ANSI escape code" (or, more properly, a "Control Sequence Introducer") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a " [ " (left-bracket) character.  An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band {{ out-of-band data }} character used to terminate an operation, as in the TECO {{ Text Editor and Corrector }} and vi text editors.  In graphical user interface (GUI) and windowing {{ window (computing) }} systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit {{ exit (operating system) }} (terminate) altogether. The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems.  The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems.  Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "Carriage Return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "Line Feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead).  The name "Carriage Return" comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line. DEC {{ Digital Equipment Corporation }} operating systems (OS/8, RT-11, RSX-11, RSTS {{ RSTS/E }} , TOPS-10, etc. ) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines {{ Teleprinter }} ) would work.  By the time so-called "glass TTYs" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention.  When Gary Kildall created CP/M he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in DEC {{ Digital Equipment Corporation }} s RT-11.  Until the introduction of PC DOS in 1981, IBM had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless.  IBMs PC DOS (also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of CP/M, and Windows inherited it from MS-DOS. Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.  To simplify matters plain text data streams, including files, on Multics used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator.  Unix and Unix-like systems, and Amiga systems, adopted this convention from Multics.  The original Macintosh OS, Apple DOS, and ProDOS, on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based macOS operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.  The Radio Shack TRS-80 also used a lone CR to terminate lines. Computers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and TENEX {{ TOPS-20#TENEX }} using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as OS/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used EBCDIC rather than ASCII.  The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII "Network Virtual Terminal" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network.  Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.  The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.  This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVTs CR-LF line-ending convention.  Older operating systems such as TOPS-10, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.  For this reason, EOF, or end-of-file, was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  The end-of-text code (ETX {{ End-of-text character }} ), also known as Control-C, was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid {{ Mnemonic device }} .  A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard. In C library and Unix conventions, the null character is used to terminate text strings {{ string (computer science) }} ; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for "zero".   } !! rowspan="2"| !! rowspan="2"|Name (67)|-! 63 !! 65 !! 67|-| 000 0000 || style="background:lightblue;" | 000 || style="background:#CFF;" | 0 || style="background:lightblue;" | 00|NULL||colspan=2|NUL|| style="font-size:large;" | ??

Printable characters
Codes 20 hex {{ hexadecimal }} to 7E hex {{ hexadecimal }} , known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.  There are 95 printable characters in total.  }}Code 20 hex {{ hexadecimal }} , the "space" character {{ Space (punctuation) }} , denotes the space between words, as produced by the space bar of a keyboard.  Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section. Code 7F hex {{ hexadecimal }} corresponds to the non-printable "delete" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous sections chart.  Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret (5E hex {{ hexadecimal }} ) and the left arrow instead of the underscore (5F hex {{ hexadecimal }} ).    | | ]] |-|111 1110 ||style="background:lightblue;"| 176 || style="background:#cff;"| 126 ||style="background:lightblue;"| 7E || ESC {{ Escape character }} || {{ Vertical bar }} || ~ {{ Tilde }} |}|}
7-bit codes
From early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.  Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdoms pound sterling (£).  Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries.  For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e. g.  é, ñ, ß, ?), currency symbols (e. g.  £, ¥), etc.  See also YUSCII (Yugoslavia). It would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for "national use".  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISOs first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCIIs choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points. ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set.  It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries.  Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway. Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc.  programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as: ä aÄiÜ = Ön; ü instead of: C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C, although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.  Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc.  (for example, in e-mail or Usenet) contained " " and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to.  For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get "N sar" as the answer, which should be "Nä jag har smörgåsar" meaning "No Ive got sandwiches".
8-bit codes
Eventually, as 8-, 16- {{ 16-bit }} and 32-bit (and later 64-bit) computers began to replace 18- {{ 18-bit }} and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII.  In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i. e. , 7-bit) characters. Encodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam).  Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard. Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics.  Kaypro CP/M computers used the "upper" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet. The PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the ZX Spectrum {{ ZX Spectrum character set }} computer.  Atari {{ ATASCII }} 8-bit computers and Galaksija {{ Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM }} computers also used ASCII variants. The IBM PC defined code page 437, which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces {{ Emoticon }} , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions.  Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware.  Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular VT220 terminal {{ computer terminal }} as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics.  The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets. The ISO/IEC 8859 standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions).  A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, Windows-1252 (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common.  ISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.
Unicode
Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments.  While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using natural numbers called code points) and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32). ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets.  This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible {{ Backward compatibility }} with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.  To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards.  Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.

<TEXT>Intro
Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion {{ Motion (physics) }} and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other.  The illusion mdash;as in motion pictures in general mdash;is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon.  Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation.  Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video.  To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector {{ Image projector }} are used along with new technologies that are produced. Animation creation methods include the traditional animation creation method and those involving stop motion animation of two and three-dimensional objects, paper cutouts {{ cutout animation }} , puppets and clay figures {{ Clay animation }} .  Images are displayed in a rapid succession, usually 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames {{ film frame }} per second.  Computer animation processes generating animated images with the general term computer-generated imagery (CGI).  3D animation {{ 3D computer graphics }} uses computer graphics, while 2D animation {{ 2D computer graphics }} is used for stylistic, low bandwidth and faster real-time renderings.
History
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion {{ motion (physics) }} into a still drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.  An earthen goblet discovered at the site of the 5,200-year-old Shahr-e Sūkhté {{ Shahr-e Sukhteh }} (Burnt City) {{ Shahr-e Sukhteh }} in southeastern Iran, depicts what could possibly be the worlds oldest example of animation.  The artifact bears five sequential images depicting a Persian Desert Ibex {{ wild goat }} jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree.  Ancient Chinese records contain several mentions of devices that were said to "give an impression of movement" to human or animal figures, these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space.  They may, of course, refer to Chinese shadow puppets. In the 19th century, the phenakistoscope (1832), zoetrope (1834) and praxinoscope (1877) were introduced.  A thaumatrope (1824) is a simple toy with a small disk with different pictures on each side; a bird in a cage and is attached to two pieces of strings.  The phenakistoscope was invented simultaneously by Belgian Joseph Plateau and Austrian Simon von Stampfer in 1831.  The phenakistoscope consists of a disk with a series of images, drawn on radi evenly space around the center of the disk.  John Barnes Linnett patented the first flip book in 1868 as the kineograph.  The common flip book were early animation devices that produced an illusion of movement from a series of sequential drawings, animation did not develop further until the advent of motion picture film {{ film }} and cinematography in the 1890s.  The cinématographe was a projector, printer, and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by historys earliest filmmakers, Auguste and Louis Lumière, in 1894.  The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by Charles-Émile Reynaud, who was a French science teacher.  Reynaud created the Praxinoscope in 1877 and the Théâtre Optique in December 1888.  On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, Pauvre Pierrot, at the Musée Grévin in Paris.  This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used.  His films were not photographed, they were drawn directly onto the transparent strip.  In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.  The first film that was recorded on standard picture film and included animated sequences was the 1900 Enchanted Drawing {{ The Enchanted Drawing }} , which was followed by the first entirely animated film - the 1906 Humorous Phases of Funny Faces by J.  Stuart Blackton, who, because of that, is considered the father of American animation.  by Émile Cohl]] In Europe, the French artist, Émile Cohl, created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation creation methods - the 1908 Fantasmagorie {{ Fantasmagorie (1908 film) }} .  The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, a wine bottle that transforms into a flower.  There were also sections of live action in which the animators hands would enter the scene.  The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film, which gave the picture a blackboard look.  The author of the first puppet-animated film (The Beautiful Lukanida (1912)) was the Russian-born (ethnically Polish {{ Poles }} ) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as Ladislas Starevich.  More detailed hand-drawn animation, requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by Winsor McCay, a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 Little Nemo {{ Little Nemo (1911 film) }} , the 1914 Gertie the Dinosaur, and the 1918 The Sinking of the Lusitania.  Gertie the Dinosaur was an early example of the character development in drawn animation.  During the 1910s, the production of animated short films typically referred to as "cartoons {{ animated cartoon }} ", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters.  The most successful producer at the time was John Randolph Bray, who, along with animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation {{ Traditional animation#Cels }} process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.   El Apóstol (Spanish: "The Apostle") was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the worlds first animated feature film.  Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valles film studio incinerated the only known copy of El Apóstol, and it is now considered a lost film.  In 1958, Hanna-Barbera released Huckleberry Hound, the first half hour television program to feature only in animation.  Terrytoons released Tom Terrific that same year.  Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theaters. Computer animation has become popular since Toy Story (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.  In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68. 4 billion.  Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the mid-2010s because well-made animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all four quadrants {{ Four-quadrant movie }} .  Animated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins (around 52%) of all film genres in the 2004–2013 timeframe.
Production
The creation of non-trivial animation works (i. e. , longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of filmmaking, with certain unique aspects.  One thing live-action and animated feature-length films {{ Feature film }} do have in common is that they are both extremely labor-intensive and have high production costs.  The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.  It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).  It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.  Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole.  While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i. e. , real-time improvisation).  Another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger.  Animators, like all artists, necessarily have their own individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film.  Since the early 1980s, feature-length animated films have been created by teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators.  It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each others styles; it is harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another.  This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins.  Character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.  On traditionally animated projects, maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.  Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.  In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.
Criticism
Criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception.  With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.  Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.  Certain under-representation of women has been criticized in animation films and the industry.
Awards
As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field.  The original awards for animation were presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th Academy Awards function.  The first winner of the Academy Award {{ 5th Academy Awards }} was the short Flowers and Trees, a production by Walt Disney Productions.  The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002.  It was won by the film Shrek, produced by DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images.  Disney/Pixar have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award.  The list of both awards can be obtained here: Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Academy Award for Best Animated Short FilmSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation (since 2008), BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film (since 2006), César Award for Best Animated Film (since 2011), Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation (since 1981), Goya Award for Best Animated Film (since 1989), Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year (since 2007), National Film Award for Best Animated Film (since 2006).  Also since 2007, the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film has been awarded at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.  Since 2009, the European Film Awards have awarded the European Film Award for Best Animated Film.  The Annie Award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation.  Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor.  They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated feature.  The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award.  The list of awardees is as follows:  Annie Award for Best Animated Feature Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production

Traditional animation
Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.  The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.  To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it.  The animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.  The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film.  The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century.  Today, animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.  Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.  The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional 35 nbsp;mm film and newer media with digital video.  The "look" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.  Some animation producers have used the term "tradigital" (a play on the words "traditional" and "digital") to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technologies. Examples of traditionally animated feature films include Pinocchio {{ Pinocchio (1940 film) }} (United States, 1940), Animal Farm {{ Animal Farm (1954 film) }} (United Kingdom, 1954), and The Illusionist {{ The Illusionist (2010 film) }} (British-French, 2010).  Traditionally animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include The Lion King (US, 1994), The Prince of Egypt (US, 1998), Akira {{ Akira (1988 film) }} (Japan, 1988), Spirited Away (Japan, 2001), The Triplets of Belleville (France, 2003), and The Secret of Kells (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).  Full animation refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement, having a smooth animation.  Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works those produced by the Walt Disney studio {{ Walt Disney Animation Studios }} (The Little Mermaid {{ The Little Mermaid (1989 film) }} , Beauty and the Beast {{ Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) }} , Aladdin {{ Aladdin (1992 Disney film) }} , The Lion King) to the more cartoon styles of the Warner Bros.  animation studio {{ Warner Bros.  Cartoons }} .  Many of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, The Secret of NIMH (US, 1982), The Iron Giant (US, 1999), and Nocturna {{ Nocturna (Film) }} (Spain, 2007).  Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.   Limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or "skippy" movement animation.  Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation.  This is a more economic technique.  Pioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America, limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in Gerald McBoing-Boing (US, 1951), Yellow Submarine {{ Yellow Submarine (1968 film) }} (UK, 1968), and certain anime produced in Japan.  Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and other TV animation studios ) and later the Internet (web cartoons).  Rotoscoping is a technique patented by Max Fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.  The source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings, as in The Lord of the Rings {{ The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) }} (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in Waking Life (US, 2001) and A Scanner Darkly {{ A Scanner Darkly (film) }} (US, 2006).  Some other examples are Fire and Ice {{ Fire and Ice (1983 film) }} (US, 1983), Heavy Metal {{ Heavy Metal (film) }} (1981), and Aku no Hana {{ The Flowers of Evil (manga) }} (2013).  Live-action/animation {{ Films with live action and animation }} is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.  One of the earlier uses was in Koko the Clown when Koko was drawn over live action footage.  Other examples include Who Framed Roger Rabbit (US, 1988), Space Jam (US, 1996) and Osmosis Jones (US, 2001).
Stop motion animation
Stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.  There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.  Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; however, traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.   Puppet animation typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.  The puppets generally have an armature {{ armature (sculpture) }} inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.  Examples include The Tale of the Fox (France, 1937), The Nightmare Before Christmas (US, 1993), Corpse Bride (US, 2005), Coraline {{ Coraline (film) }} (US, 2009), the films of Jiří Trnka and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series Robot Chicken (US, 2005–present).  Puppetoon, created using techniques developed by George Pal, are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.   television commercial]] Clay animation, or Plasticine animation (often called claymation, which, however, is a trademark {{ Laika (company) }} ed name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.  The figures may have an armature {{ armature (sculpture) }} or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.  Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of Bruce Bickford {{ Bruce Bickford (animator) }} , where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes.  Examples of clay-animated works include The Gumby Show {{ Gumby }} (US, 1957–1967) Morph {{ Morph (animation) }} shorts (UK, 1977–2000), Wallace and Gromit shorts (UK, as of 1989), Jan Švankmajers Dimensions of Dialogue (Czechoslovakia, 1982), The Trap Door (UK, 1984).  Films include Wallace Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Chicken Run and The Adventures of Mark Twain {{ The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film) }} .   Strata-cut animation, Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like "loaf" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.   Cutout animation is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.  Examples include Terry Gilliams animated sequences from Monty Pythons Flying Circus (UK, 1969–1974); Fantastic Planet (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; Tale of Tales {{ Tale of Tales (1979 film) }} (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of South Park (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).  Silhouette animation is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.  Examples include The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Weimar Republic, 1926) and Princes et princesses {{ Ciné si }} (France, 2000).  Model animation refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.  Intercutting, matte {{ matte (filmmaking) }} effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.  Examples include the work of Ray Harryhausen, as seen in films, Jason and the Argonauts {{ Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film) }} (1963), and the work of Willis H.  OBrien on films, King Kong {{ King Kong (1933 film) }} (1933).  Go motion is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.  The technique was invented by Industrial Light Magic and Phil Tippett to create special effect scenes for the film The Empire Strikes Back (1980).  Another example is the dragon named "Vermithrax" from Dragonslayer (1981 film).   Object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.   Graphic animation uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc. ), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.  At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.  Brickfilm are a subgenre of object animation involving using Lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation.  These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, YouTube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.   Pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.  This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.  Examples of pixilation include The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and Angry Kid shorts.
Computer animation
Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.  2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.  3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.
Mechanical animation
Animatronics is the use of mechatronics to create machines which seem animate rather than robotic.  Audio-Animatronics and Autonomatronics {{ Audio-Animatronics }} is a form of robotics animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by Walt Disney Imagineering for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song).  They are fixed to whatever supports them.  They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk.  An Audio-Animatron is different from an android {{ android (robot) }} -type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli.  In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.   Linear Animation Generator is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft.  The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.  The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.  Chuckimation is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series Action League Now! in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.   Puppetry is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets.  It is very ancient and is believed to have originated 3000 years BC.  Puppetry takes many forms, they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects.  Puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment – in performance – and ceremonially in rituals, celebrations, and carnivals.  Most puppetry involves storytelling.   Zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures.  The term zoetrope is from the Greek {{ Greek language }} words ζωή (zoē), meaning "alive, active", and τ?όπος (tropos), meaning "turn", with "zoetrope" taken to mean "active turn" or "wheel of life".
Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches
Hydrotechnics: a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.  Drawn on film animation: a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock, for example by Norman McLaren, Len Lye and Stan Brakhage.  Paint-on-glass animation: a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass, for example by Aleksandr Petrov {{ Aleksandr Petrov (animator) }} .  Erasure animation: a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.  For example, William Kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films, and Piotr Dumała for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.  Pinscreen animation: makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.  The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows.  The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.   Sand animation: sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.  This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast {{ Contrast (vision) }} .   Flip book: a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.  Flip books are often illustrated books for children, they also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings.  Flip books are not always separate books, they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.  Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.   Character animation Multi-sketching Special effects animation
2D animation
2D animation {{ 2D computer graphics }} figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D bitmap graphics {{ Raster graphics }} or created and edited using 2D vector graphics.  This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, interpolated {{ Interpolation }} morphing, onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping. 2D animation has many applications, including analog computer animation {{ Scanimate }} , Flash animation, and PowerPoint animation.  Cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated GIF file of which part is animated.  Final line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation, to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.  Speaking about using this approach in Paperman, John Kahrs said that "Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm. "
3D animation
3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator.  The animator usually starts by creating a 3D polygon mesh to manipulate.  A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.  Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature {{ Armature (computer animation) }} that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.  This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement. Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e. g. , gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and water simulations.  These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.
3D terms
Cel-shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.  Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.  Examples include Skyland (2007, France), The Iron Giant (1999, United States), Futurama (Fox, 1999) Appleseed Ex Machina (2007, Japan), The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002, Japan) Machinima – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds.  Motion capture is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters.  Examples include Polar Express {{ The Polar Express (film) }} (2004, US), Beowulf {{ Beowulf (2007 film) }} (2007, US), A Christmas Carol {{ A Christmas Carol (2009 film) }} (2009, US), The Adventures of Tintin (film) (2011, US) kochadiiyan {{ Kochadaiiyaan }} (2014, India).  Photo-realistic animation {{ Computer animation }} is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc.  Examples include Up {{ Up (2009 film) }} (2009, US), How to Train Your Dragon {{ How to Train Your Dragon (film) }} (2010, US), Ice Age {{ Ice Age (2002 film) }} (2002, US).

<TEXT>Intro
Apollo (Attic {{ Attic Greek }} , Ionic {{ Ionic Greek }} , and Homeric Greek: , Apoll?n ( ); Doric {{ Doric Greek }} : , Apell?n; Arcadocypriot {{ Arcadocypriot Greek }} : , Apeil?n; Aeolic {{ Aeolic Greek }} : , Aploun; ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities {{ Twelve Olympians }} in classical Greek {{ Ancient Greek religion }} and Roman religion {{ Ancient Roman religion }} and Greek {{ Greek mythology }} and Roman mythology.  The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more.  Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.  Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.  As the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle {{ Pythia }} .  Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague {{ Plague (disease) }} .  Amongst the gods custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists {{ Colonies in antiquity }} , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.  As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musegetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry.  Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo {{ Apollo#Attributes and symbols }} .  Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan {{ Titan (mythology) }} god of the sun {{ solar deity }} , and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, Titan goddess of the moon {{ lunar deity }} .  In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol {{ Sol (mythology) }} among the Augustan poets {{ Classical Latin }} of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161–215).  Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.
Etymology
, Naples, Italy. ]]The name Apollo—unlike the related older name {{ List of Mycenaean deities }} Paean—is generally not found in the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose {{ Lacuna (manuscripts) }} form ]pe-rjo-[ (Linear B: ] -[) on the KN {{ Knossos }} E 842 tablet.  The etymology of the name is uncertain.  The spelling ( in Classical Attic {{ Attic Greek }} ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric {{ Dorians }} form Apellon ( ), is more archaic, derived from an earlier .  It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios ( ), and the offerings apellaia ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai ( ).  According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella ( ), which originally meant "wall," "fence for animals" and later "assembly within the limits of the square. " Apella ( ) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the ecclesia {{ Ecclesia (ancient Athens) }} ( ).  R.  S.  P.  Beekes {{ Robert S.  P.  Beekes }} rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form Apal y un.  Several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors.  Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollos name with the Greek verb (apollymi), "to destroy".  Plato in Cratylus connects the name with (apolysis), "redemption", with (apolousis), "purification", and with ([h]aploun), "simple", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, , and finally with (aeiballon), "ever-shooting".  Hesychius {{ Hesychius of Alexandria }} connects the name Apollo with the Doric (apella), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation (sekos), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.  In the ancient Macedonian language (pella) means "stone," and some toponyms may be derived from this word: (Pella, the capital of ancient Macedonia {{ Macedonia (ancient kingdom) }} ) and (Pellēnē/Pallene {{ Pallini }} ).  A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name, The Hittite {{ Hittite language }} form Apaliunas ( d ) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter, perhaps related to Hurrian (and certainly the Etruscan {{ List of Etruscan mythological figures }} ) Aplu {{ Aplu (deity) }} , a god of plague, in turn likely from Akkadian Aplu Enlil meaning simply "the son of Enlil", a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the sun.  The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of Apollo Smintheus ("mouse Apollo") by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague). The Hittite {{ Hittite language }} testimony reflects an early form , which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric .  A Luwian {{ Luwian language }} etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".
Origins
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE.  The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollos twin sister.  At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho.  For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods.  In archaic Greece {{ archaic period in Greece }} he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing".  In classical Greece {{ classical period in Greece }} he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.  Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component. "From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of "symbols and omina {{ omen }} " (σημεία και τέ?ατα : semeia kai terata), and of the observation of the omens of the days.  The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from Anatolia.  The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning.  The Greeks created the legalism {{ Legalism (Western philosophy) }} , the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony.  Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order.  The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people.
Oracular cult
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi.  In cult practice, Delian Apollo {{ Delos }} and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.  Apollos cult {{ Cult (religion) }} was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE.  Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period {{ Archaic Greece }} , and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity.  Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites.  In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Clarus pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity {{ Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism }} .  "In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent.  Julian the Apostate (359 - 61) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed. "
Temples of Apollo
A lot of temples dedicated to Apollo were built in Greece and in the Greek colonies, and they show the spread of the cult of Apollo, and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form, and on mathematical relations.  Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, dont belong to any Greek order.  It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures.  The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order.  The Greeks used standard types, because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances.  The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection.  From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings.  The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed, some mathematical relations became necessary, in order to keep the original forms.  This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics.   The Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century B. C, but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn’t be solved without changing the original forms.  The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple.  Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age, and under Rome. The most important temples are:
Festivals
The chief Apollonian festivals were the Boedromia, Carneia, Carpiae, Daphnephoria, Delia {{ Delia (festival) }} , Hyacinthia, Metageitnia, Pyanepsia, Pythia and Thargelia.
Attributes and symbols
Apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow.  Other attributes of his included the kithara (an advanced version of the common lyre), the plectrum and the sword.  Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers.  The Pythian Games were held in Apollos honor every four years at Delphi.  The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory {{ laurel wreath }} at these games. The palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos.  Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves {{ wolf }} , dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crow {{ Corvus (genus) }} s, snakes (referencing Apollos function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.  As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE.  According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan {{ Crete }} or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy.  However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite {{ Hittites }} cuneiform {{ Cuneiform script }} texts mention a Minor Asian god called Appaliunas or Apalunas in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion {{ Troy }} by most scholars.  In this interpretation, Apollos title of Lykegenes can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology). In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder.  The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian.  However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus.  This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase. Apollo is often associated with the Golden Mean {{ Golden mean (philosophy) }} .  This is the Greek ideal {{ Ideal (ethics) }} of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony.
Apollo in the arts
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance.  The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" ( , agalma), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision.  Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined.  The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought. The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.  The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment.  The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world. The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal Kouros type in early archaic period {{ Archaic period in Greece }} , to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period {{ Archaic period in Greece }} .  In classical Greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by Polykleitos.  Finally Praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism {{ Realism (arts) }} with stylization.
Modern reception
Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature.  Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the gods instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinskys Apollon musagète (1927–1928).  In 1978, the Canadian band Rush {{ Rush (band) }} released an album {{ Hemispheres (Rush album) }} with songs "Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom"/"Dionysus: Bringer of Love" {{ Cygnus X-1 (song series)#Book II: Hemispheres }} . In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity.  Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable.  Carl Jungs Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance. Charles Handy, in Gods of Management (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture {{ organizational culture }} .  Apollo represents a role culture where order, reason and bureaucracy prevail.  In spaceflight, the NASA program for landing astronauts on the Moon was named Apollo {{ Apollo program }} .

Greco-Roman epithets
Apollos chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , Phoibos ), literally "bright".  It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollos role as the god of light.  Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god.  However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in Latin literature.
Celtic epithets and cult titles
Apollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire.  In the traditionally Celtic {{ Celtic nations }} lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god.  He was often equated with Celtic gods {{ List of Celtic gods }} of similar character.   Apollo Atepomarus ("the great horseman" or "possessing a great horse").

Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins dAnnecy (Haute-Savoie) and at Jublains (Maine-et-Loire).
Healer and god-protector from evil
The function of Apollo as a "healer" is connected with Paean {{ Paean (god) }} ( ), the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, who seems to come from a more primitive religion.  Paeοn is probably connected with the Mycenean {{ Mycenean Greece }} pa-ja-wo-ne (Linear B: ), but this is not certain.  He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease.  Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song "paean" ( ).  The magicians were also called "seer-doctors" ( ), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.  In the Iliad, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra.  He sends a plague ( ) to the Achaeans {{ Achaeans (Homer) }} .  The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil.  When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the Paean.  Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are "paion" ( , literally "healer" or "helper") "epikourios" ( , "help"), "oulios" ( , "healed wound", also a "scar" ) and "loimios" ( , "plague").  In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called "apotropaios" ( , "divert", "deter", "avert") and "alexikakos" (from v.  {{ verb }} + n.  {{ noun }} , "defend from evil").  In later writers, the word, usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.  Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.  Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollos son Asclepius the healer.  About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered.  It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music.  Apollos role as the slayer of the Python {{ Python (mythology) }} led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman {{ Ancient Rome }} custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.
Dorian origin
The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month Apellaios in northwest Greek calendars .  The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (Doric {{ Dorians }} form: ).  Apellaios is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the "megistos kouros" (the great Kouros).  However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian {{ Ancient Macedonian language }} word "pella" (Pella), stone.  Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).  The "Homeric hymn" represents Apollo as a Northern intruder.  His arrival must have occurred during the "Dark Ages" that followed the destruction of the Mycenaean civilization {{ Mycenaean Greece }} , and his conflict with Gaia {{ Gaia (mythology) }} (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent Python {{ Python (mythology) }} .  The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.  The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated.  A female dragon named Delphyne ( , "womb"), and a male serpent Typhon ( , "to smoke"), the adversary of Zeus in the Titanomachy, who the narrators confused with Python {{ Python (mythology) }} .  Python was the good daemon {{ Daemon (classical mythology) }} (ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} religion, but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.  Apollo and his sister Artemis can bring death with their arrows.  The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in Germanic {{ Germanic mythology }} and Norse mythology.  In Greek mythology Artemis was the leader ( , "hegemon") of the nymphs, who had similar functions with the Nordic {{ Norse mythology }} Elves {{ Elf }} .  The "elf-shot" originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone arrow {{ arrow (weapon) }} -heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.  The Vedic Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo.  The terrible god is called "The Archer", and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva.  Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god.  However the Indo-European {{ Indo-European language }} component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.
Minoan origin
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean {{ Mycenaean Greece }} ages.  In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden {{ labrys }} , "the double-axe men", which indicates Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} origin.  The double-axe, labrys, was the holy symbol of the Cretan {{ Crete }} labyrinth.  The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices.  Apollo Delphinios or Delphidios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands.  Apollos sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} "Mistress of the animals".  In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the "Mister of the animals", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute.  His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin "Mistress of the Animals", becoming her brother.  The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple.  This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition.  In that regard, the mythical seeress Sibyl of Anatolian origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.  However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.  Plato describes the priestesses of Delphi and Dodona as frenzied women, obsessed by "mania" ( , "frenzy"), a Greek word he connected with mantis ( , "prophet").  Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the Near East as Mari {{ Mari, Syria }} in the second millennium BC.  Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC, there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages.  It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.
Anatolian origin
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.  The name of Apollos mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor.  The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines.  Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro {{ Assyria }} -Babylonian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites.  In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain "purification".  A similar story is mentioned by Plutarch.  He writes that the Cretan seer {{ prophet }} Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seers expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state.  The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of Asia {{ Shamanism#Asia }} , and proves, together with the Homeric hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times.  It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to Anatolia. Homer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans {{ Troy }} , fighting against the Achaeans {{ Achaeans (Homer) }} , during the Trojan War.  He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods.  The god seems to be related to Appaliunas, a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.  The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo.  The Greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.  However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.  The Late Bronze Age (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) Hittite {{ Hittites }} and Hurrian Aplu was a god of plague {{ Plague (disease) }} , invoked during plague years.  Here we have an apotropaic {{ apotrope }} situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it.  Aplu, meaning the son of, was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash.  Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ( ) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.  In Iliad, his priest prays to Apollo Smintheus, the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.  All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean {{ Paean (god) }} , who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.
Oracular shrines
Apollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Clarus and Branchidae.  His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet Abaeus ( , Apollon Abaios), was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.  His oracular shrines include: Abae in Phocis.  Bassae in the Peloponnese.  At Clarus, on the west coast of Asia Minor; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma, from which the priests drank.  In Corinth {{ Ancient Corinth }} , the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of Tenea, from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.  At Khyrse, in Troad, the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.  In Delos, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer.  The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.  In Delphi, the Pythia became filled with the pneuma of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the Adyton.  In Didyma, an oracle on the coast of Anatolia, south west of Lydian (Luwian) Sardis, in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple.  Was believed to have been founded by Branchus, son or lover of Apollo.  In Hierapolis Bambyce {{ Manbij }} , Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise De Dea Syria, the sanctuary of the Syrian Goddess {{ Atargatis }} contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo.  Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.   At Patara {{ Patara (Lycia) }} , in Lycia, there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos.  As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.  In Segesta in Sicily. Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.  In Oropus, north of Athens, the oracle Amphiaraus, was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.  in Labadea, east of Delphi, Trophonius, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.
Greek temples
Thebes, Greece: The oldest temple probably dedicated to Apollo Ismenius was built in the 9th century B. C It seems that it was a curvilinear building.  The Doric {{ Doric order }} temple was built in the early 7th century B.

The temple measures 40,00 X23,00 m at the stylobate, and the number of pteron columns was 8 X 14.
Etruscan and Roman temples
Veii (Etruria): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century B. C. , and indicates the spread of Apollo’s culture (Aplu) in Etruria.  There was a prostyle porch, which is called Tuscan {{ Tuscan order }} , and a triple cella 18,50 m wide.   Falerii Veteres (Etruria): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th-3rd century B. C.  Parts of a teraccotta capital, and a teraccotta base have been found.  It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.  A cult of Apollo Soranus {{ Soranus (mythology) }} is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.    Pompeii, (Italy): The cult of Apollo, was widespread in the region of Campania, since the 6th century B. C.  The temple was built in 120 B. V, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century BC.  It was reconstructed after an earthquake in A. D 63.  It demonstrates a mixing of styles, which formed the basis of Roman architecture.  The columns in front of the cella formed a Tuscan {{ Tuscan order }} prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back.  The peripteral colonnade of 48 Ionic {{ Ionic order }} columns was placed in such a way, that the emphasis was given to the front side.   Rome: The temple of Apollo Sosianus and the temple of Apollo Medicus.  The first temple building dates to 431 BC, and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 BC.  It was rebuilt by Gaius Sosius, probably in 34 B. C.  Only three columns with Corinthian {{ Corinthian order }} capitals exist today.  It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century BC.   Rome:The temple of Apollo Palatinus was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city.  It was dedicated by Augustus on 28 B. C.  The façade of the original temple was Ionic {{ Ionic order }} , and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble.  Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance, and a statue of Apollo in the cella.   Melite {{ Melite (ancient city) }} (modern Mdina, Malta): A Temple of Apollo {{ Temple of Apollo (Melite) }} was built in the city in the 2nd century AD.  Its remains were discovered in the 18th century, and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures.  Parts of the temples podium were rediscovered in 2002.
Birth
When Zeus wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on terra firma {{ Solid Earth }} .  In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island.  She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city.  Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.  This island later became sacred to Apollo. It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.  The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards (8 m) long, of amber.  Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.  Apollo was born on the seventh day ( , hebdomagenes) of the month Thargelion {{ Attic calendar#Festival calendar }} —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios {{ Hellenic calendars#Delphic }} —according to Delphian tradition.  The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.
Youth
Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the chthonic dragon Python {{ Python (mythology) }} , which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring.  This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies.  Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world.  To protect his mother, Apollo begged Hephaestus for a bow and arrows.  After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.  Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of Gaia {{ Gaia (mythology) }} . Hera then sent the giant Tityos to rape Leto.  This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother.  During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus.  There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver.
Trojan War
Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the Trojan War in retribution for Agamemnons insult to Chryses, a priest of Apollo whose daughter Chryseis had been captured.  He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles {{ Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad }} , which is the theme of the Iliad. In the Iliad, when Diomedes injured Aeneas, Apollo rescued him.  First, Aphrodite tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.  Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy. Apollo aided Paris {{ Paris (mythology) }} in the killing of Achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into Achilles heel.  One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles sacrilege in murdering Troilus, the gods own son by Hecuba, on the very altar {{ Ancient Greek religion#Practices }} of the gods own temple.
Admetus
When Zeus struck down Apollos son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting Hippolytus {{ Hippolytus (mythology) }} from the dead (transgressing Themis by stealing Hadess subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes {{ Cyclops }} , who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.  Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor {{ Penal labour }} , due to the intercession of his mother, Leto.  During this time he served as shepherd for King Admetus {{ Admetus }} of Pherae in Thessaly.  Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus. Apollo helped Admetus win Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias {{ Pelias }} and later convinced the Fates {{ Moirai }} to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place.  But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate.  Instead, Alcestis took his place, but Heracles managed to "persuade {{ Coercion }} " Thanatos, the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.
Niobe
Niobe, the queen of Thebes {{ Thebes (Greece) }} and wife of Amphion, boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared (Chloris, usually).  Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos {{ Spil Mount }} in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept.  Her tears formed the river Achelous.  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.
Consorts and children
Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.  Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.
Apollos lyre
Hermes was born on Mount Cyllene {{ Mount Kyllini }} in Arcadia.  The story is told in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes.  His mother, Maia {{ Maia (mythology) }} , had been secretly impregnated by Zeus.  Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to Thessaly, where Apollo was grazing his cattle.  The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks.  In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides.  He used one of the cows intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollos claim.  Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo.  Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented.  Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre.  Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.
Apollo in the Oresteia
In Aeschylus Oresteia trilogy, Clytemnestra kills her husband, King Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war, and Cassandra, a prophetess of Apollo.  Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnons son, Orestes, is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, her lover.  Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes (Furies, female personifications of vengeance {{ revenge }} ). Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage.  They invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before Athena.  Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollos supplicant.  Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

Roman Apollo
The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.  As a quintessentially Greek god {{ List of Greek mythological figures }} , Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus.  There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome {{ Roman Kingdom }} during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.  On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollos first temple {{ Temple of Apollo Sosianus }} at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare".  During the Second Punic War in 212 BCE, the Ludi Apollinares ("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.  In the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.  After the battle of Actium, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollos temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour.  He also erected a new temple {{ Temple of Apollo (Palatine) }} to the god on the Palatine hill {{ Palatine Hill }} .  Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana {{ Diana (mythology) }} formed the culmination of the Secular Games, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.
Art and Greek philosophy
The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of Thales to the metaphysical {{ Metaphysics }} theory of Pythagoras.  Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older animism.  This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.  Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.  The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations ( , eikones, "images") of the celestial world of numbers.  His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art, and the Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.  (canon {{ Aesthetic canon }} ). In classical Greece, Anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and Plato extended the Greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai, "ideas").  The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas.  The Greek words oida ( , "(I) know") and eidos ( , "species"), a thing seen, have the same root as the word idea ( ), a thing ἰδείν to see.  indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses.  The artists in Platos time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization.  The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.
Archaic sculpture
Kouros (male youth) is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in Greece.  This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of Apollo.  The first statues are certainly still and formal.  The formality of their stance seems to be related with the Egyptian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason.  The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness.  When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.  The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented.  These forms expressed immortality.  Apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order.  His shrine in Delphi, that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: (gn?thi seautón="know thyself") and (mēdén ágan, "nothing in excess"), and (eggýa pára datē, "make a pledge and mischief is nigh").   In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw ones attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life.  The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost animistic {{ animism }} idea that the statues are in some sense alive.  This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.  A fine example is the statue of the Sacred gate Kouros which was found at the cemetery of Dipylon in Athens (Dipylon Kouros).  The statue is the "thing in itself", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity.  According to the Greek tradition the Dipylon master {{ Dipylon }} was named Daedalus, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move.  It is considered that he created also the New York kouros, which is the oldest fully preserved statue of Kouros type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.   The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the Homeric poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god Hephaestus (Phaistos) and the mythic Daedalus (the builder of the labyrinth) that made images which moved of their own accord.  This kind of art goes back to the Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.  These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta. The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the Ionic {{ Ionians }} sanctuary on the island of Delos.  Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia alone.  The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole.  Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo.  It was found in Piraeus, the harbour of Athens.  The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand.  It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus.  The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art.  The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler, and heavier style, restricts Ionian influence in Athens.  Finally, this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later.
Classical sculpture
In the next century which is the beginning of the Classical period {{ Classical Greece }} , it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions.  The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment (Myron), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} element.  Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other.  The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances.  Polykleitos in his Canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.  It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.  The famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm.  The type is represented by neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of Polykleitos but more archaic.  The Apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone.  The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan {{ Minoan civilization }} period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek {{ Greek language }} speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age.  Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art.  Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form.  Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same.  Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.  Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.
Pediments and friezes
In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base. The Siphnian Treasury in Delphi was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling.  The pediment shows the story of Heracles stealing Apollos tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration.  Their two figures hold the centre.  In the pediment of the temple of Zeus in Olympia {{ Olympia, Greece }} , the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.    These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake.  They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole.  While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs.  In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield.  The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.
Hellenistic Greece-Rome
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a kithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types).  The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans, from the Renaissance through the 19th century.  The marble is a Hellenistic {{ Hellenistic Greece }} or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, made between 350 and 325 BCE. The life-size so-called "Adonis" found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana {{ Roman villa }} near the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars.  In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem, Roman Thysdrus, he is identifiable as Apollo Helios {{ Helios }} by his effulgent halo {{ Halo (religious iconography) }} , though now even a gods divine nakedness {{ nudity }} is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire {{ Roman Empire }} . Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse.  The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut {{ Hairstyle }} in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great.  Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

Female lovers
Daphne was a nymph, daughter of the river god {{ Sea and river deity }} Peneus, who had scorned Apollo.  The myth explains the connection of Apollo with δάφνη (daphnē), the laurel {{ Bay Laurel }} whose leaves his priestess employed at Delphi.  In Ovids Metamorphoses, Phoebus Apollo chaffs Cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo.  Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father, Peneus, for help, and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo. Artemis Daphnaia, who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi in Antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier, had her own sacred laurel trees.  At Eretria the identity of an excavated 7th- and 6th-century temple to Apollo Daphnephoros, "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", a "place where the citizens are to take the oath", is identified in inscriptions.  Leucothea was daughter of Orchamus and sister of Clytia.  She fell in love with Apollo who disguised himself as Leucotheas mother to gain entrance to her chambers.  Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sisters trust and confidence in her.  Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive.  Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died.  Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day. Marpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well.  Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old. Castalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved.  She fled from him and dove into the spring {{ castalian Spring }} at Delphi, at the base of Mt.  Parnassos, which was then named after her.  Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.  In the last oracle is mentioned that the "water which could speak", has been lost for ever. By Cyrene {{ Cyrene (mythology) }} , Apollo had a son named Aristaeus, who became the patron god of cattle, fruit trees, hunting, husbandry and bee-keeping.  He was also a culture-hero and taught humanity dairy skills, the use of nets and traps in hunting, and how to cultivate olives. Hecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy, and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus.  An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive.  He was ambushed and killed by Achilleus. Cassandra, was daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus half-sister.  Apollo fell in love with Cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.  Enraged, Apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her. Coronis {{ Coronis (Greek mythology) }} , was daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths.  Pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus.  A crow informed Apollo of the affair.  When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths.  When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis).  As a result, he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths.  Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise.  Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.  Apollo then killed him for what he did. In Euripides play Ion {{ Ion (play) }} , Apollo fathered Ion {{ Ion (mythology) }} by Creusa, wife of Xuthus.  Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess. Acantha, was the spirit of the acanthus {{ Acanthus (genus) }} tree, and Apollo had one of his other liaisons with her.  Upon her death, Apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb. According to the Biblioteca {{ Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus) }} , the "library" of mythology mis-attributed to Apollodorus, he fathered the Corybantes on the Muse Thalia {{ Thalia (Muse) }} .

Male lovers
Hyacinth {{ Hyacinth (mythology) }} or Hyacinthus was one of Apollos male lovers.  He was a Spartan prince, beautiful and athletic.  The pair was practicing throwing the discus {{ Discus throw }} when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly.  Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus blood, Apollo created a flower {{ hyacinth (plant) }} named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning alas.  The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta. Another male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles.  Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin {{ Pilum }} as it lay asleep in the undergrowth.  Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever.  Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress {{ Cupressaceae }} named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk. Other male lovers of Apollo include: Admetus  Atymnius, otherwise known as a beloved of Sarpedon Branchus (alternately, a son of Apollo) Carnus Clarus  Hippolytus of Sicyon (not the same as Hippolytus, the son of Theseus {{ Hippolytus (mythology) }} )  Hymenaios  Iapis Leucates, who threw himself off a rock when Apollo attempted to carry him off  Phorbas (probably the son of Triopas)  Potnieus
Pan
Once Pan {{ Pan (mythology) }} had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the kithara, to a trial of skill.  Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.  Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present.  Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.  Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.  He dissented and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.
Marsyas
Apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: Marsyas was a satyr who challenged Apollo to a contest of music.  He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy.  The contest was judged by the Muses. After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time.  As Apollo played the lyre, this was easy to do.  Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time.  Apollo was declared the winner because of this.  Apollo flayed {{ flaying }} Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god.  He then nailed Marsyas shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree.  Marsyas blood turned into the river Marsyas {{ Marsyas (river) }} . Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down.  Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.
Cinyras
Apollo also had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

<TEXT>Intro
Andre Kirk Agassi ( ; born April 29, 1970) is an American {{ United States }} retired professional tennis player and former World No.  1 {{ List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players }} who was one of the sports most dominant players from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.  Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time {{ 100 Greatest of All Time }} , Agassi had been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game.  Described by the BBC upon his retirement as "perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sports history", Agassi compiled performances that, along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude, saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game.  As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.  In singles tennis, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam {{ Grand Slam (tennis) }} champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist {{ Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics }} , as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments.  During the Open Era {{ History of tennis#Open Era }} , Agassi was the first male player to have won 4 Australian Open titles, a record that was later surpassed by Novak Djokovic when he won his 5th title on 2015, and then by Roger Federer in 2017.  Agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam {{ Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam }} in the Open Era and one of eight in history, the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam {{ Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Golden Slam }} (Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships {{ ATP World Tour Finals }} (won in 1990 {{ 1990 ATP Tour World Championships }} ): a distinction dubbed as a "Career Super Slam" by Sports Illustrated.  Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win both the French Open (in 1999) and the Australian Open (in 2003).  He also won 17 ATP Masters Series {{ ATP World Tour Masters 1000 }} titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990 {{ 1990 Davis Cup }} , 1992 {{ 1992 Davis Cup }} and 1995 {{ 1995 Davis Cup }} .  Agassi reached the World No.  1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No.  141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over.  Agassi returned to World No.  1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years.  During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname "The Punisher".  After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open {{ US Open (tennis) }} to Benjamin Becker.  He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 nbsp;million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada.  In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children.  He has been married to fellow tennis player Steffi Graf since 2001.
1970–85: Early life
Andre Agassi was born in Las Vegas, Nevada to Emmanuel "Mike" Agassi {{ Emmanuel Agassi }} , a former Olympic boxer from Iran and Elizabeth "Betty" Agassi (née Dudley).  His father stated he is from a mixed, mostly Armenian {{ Iranian Armenians }} , heritage.  He later elaborated that his grandfather was Assyrian {{ Assyrian people }} who "married an Armenian woman. " Andre Agassis mother, Betty, is a breast cancer survivor.  He has three older siblings – Rita (last wife to Pancho Gonzales), Philip and Tami.  One of his ancestors changed his surname from Agassian to Agassi to avoid persecution.  In a passage from the book Open, Agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend Jim Brown, in 1979, when Agassi was 9 years old.  Brown was at a Vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled.  Agassis father stepped in and told Brown that he could play his son and he would put up his house for the wager.  Brown countered with a $10,000 bet, but after he was warned by the club owner not to take the bet because he would lose and be embarrassed, Brown agreed with Mike Agassi that they would set the amount after he and Andre played two sets.  Brown lost those sets, 3–6, 3–6, declined the 10K wager, and offered to play the third set for $500.  He lost 2–6.  At age 13, Andre was sent to Nick Bollettieris Tennis Academy in Florida.  He was meant to stay for only 3 months because that was all his father could afford.  After thirty minutes of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri called Mike and said: "Take your check back.  Hes here for free," claiming that Agassi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen.  Agassi dropped out of school in the ninth grade.
Earnings
Agassi earned more than $30 nbsp;million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, Sampras and Murray to date (October 22, 2015).  He also earned more than $25 nbsp;million a year through endorsements during his career, fourth in all sports at the time.
Post-retirement
Since retiring after the 2006 US Open {{ 2006 US Open (tennis) }} , Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity.  On September 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open {{ 2007 US Open (tennis) }} quarterfinal.  He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters.  He played World Team Tennis for the Philadelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009.  At the 2009 French Open, Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer, who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.  Also in 2009 Agassi played at the Outback Champions Series event for the first time.  He played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships {{ Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championship at Surprise }} at Surprise, Arizona, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin.  He also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend Jim Courier.  Agassi returned to the tour renamed for the PowerShares Series in 2011 and participated in a total of seven events while winning two.  Agassi beat Courier in the final of the Staples Champions Cup in Boston and later defeated Sampras at the CTCA Championships at his hometown Las Vegas.  In 2012 Agassi took part in five tournaments, winning three of those.  In November, at first he won BILT Champions Showdown in San Jose {{ San Jose, California }} , beating John McEnroe in the final.  The following day, he defended his title of the CTCA Championships, while defeating Courier in the decisive match.  In the series season finale, he beat Michael Chang for the Acura Champions Cup.  The series and Agassi came back to action in 2014.  Agassi won both tournaments he participated in.  At the Camden Wealth Advisors Cups final in Houston, Agassi beat James Blake {{ James Blake (tennis) }} for a rematch of their 2005 US Open quarterfinal.  He defeated Blake again in Portland {{ Portland, Oregon }} to win the title of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championships.  In 2015 Agassi took part in just one event of the PowerShares Series, losing to Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Champions Shootout.  In 2009 in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final.  Sampras won the exhibition in three sets.  The rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in the "Hit for Haiti" charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake {{ 2010 Haiti earthquake }} .  Partnered with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the old rivals began making jokes on each other what ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassis body.  After the event Agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras.  Agassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets.  On March 3, 2014, Agassi and Sampras squared off for an exhibition in London for the annual World Tennis Day.  This time it was Agassi who came out on top in two straight sets.
Playing style
Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle.  His groundstrokes, return of serve, baseline game, anticipation, and eye–hand coordination were always among the best in the game.  On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner.  His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but in particular down the line.  His forehand was nearly as strong, in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.  Agassis strength was in dictating play from the back of the court.  While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.  When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more.  This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994.  Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassis two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.  A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes.  This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it. Agassis serve was never the strength of his game, but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average.  He often used his hard slice serve to the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court, followed by a shot to the opposite corner.  Agassis service speed when hitting a flat first serve would range between .  His second serve usually was a heavy "kick" serve in the mid-80s range.  Agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career.  Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.  His strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.
Business ventures
Agassi established a limited liability company named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises).  Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, Shaquille ONeal, Ken Griffey, Jr. , and Monica Seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996.  The restaurant closed down in 2001.  In 1999, he paid $1 million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank and made a $10 million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006.  In 2002, he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers and cable and satellite industry, and made an equity investment in the network.  After meeting chef Michael Mina at one of his restaurants in San Francisco, Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina Group Inc.  and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco, San Jose {{ San Jose, California }} , Dana Point, Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  Agassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Golden Nugget Laughlin from MGM Mirage {{ Mirage Resorts }} for $215 million in 2004.  One year later, the group sold the hotel-casino to Landrys, Inc.  for $163 million in cash and $182 million in assumed debt.  In 2007, he sat on the board of Meadows Bank, an independent bank in Nevada.  He has invested in start-up companies backed by Allen Company.  Agassi and Graf formed a company called Agassi Graf Holdings.  They invested in PURE, a nightclub at Caesars Palace, which opened in 2004, and sold it to Angel Management Group in 2010.  In August 2006, Agassi and Graf developed a joint venture with high-end furniture maker Kreiss Enterprises.  They launched a furniture line called Agassi Graf Collection.  In September, Agassi and Graf, through their company Agassi Graf Development LLC, along with Bayview Financial LP, finalized an agreement to develop a condominium hotel, Fairmont Tamarack, at Tamarack Resort in Donnelly, Idaho.  Due to difficult market conditions and delays, they withdrew from the project in 2009.  The group still owns three small chunks of land.  In September, they collaborated with Steve Cases Exclusive Resorts to co-develop luxury resorts and design Agassi-Graf Tennis and Fitness Centers.  They also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and both serve as board members and advisors of the company.  In October 2012, Village Roadshow and investors including Agassi and Graf announced plans to build new water park called WetnWild Las Vegas in Las Vegas.  Village Roadshow has a 51% stake in the park while Agassi, Graf, and other private investors hold the remaining 49%.  The park opened in May 2013.  IMG {{ IMG (company) }} managed Agassi from the time he turned pro in 1986 through January 2000, before switching to SFX Sports Group.  His business manager, lawyer, and agent was childhood friend Perry Rogers, but they have been estranged since 2008.  In 2009, he and Graf signed with CAA {{ Creative Artists Agency }} .
Politics
Agassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates.  On September 1, 2010, when he appeared on daily WNYC public radio program "The Brian Lehrer Show," he stated that he is a registered Independent.
Philanthropy
Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas young people.  He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth.  He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis.  It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.  Agassis charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential.  His Boys Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team.  It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics. In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area.  He personally donated $35 million to the school.  In 2009, the graduating class had 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.  Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark Countys only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven.  In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education.  His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children.  This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.  In 2007, along with several other athletes, Agassi founded the charity Athletes for Hope, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities.  He created the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund and is now known as the Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund.  The Fund is an investment initiative for social change, focusing on the "nationwide effort to move charters from stopgap buildings into permanent campuses. " It has funded over 30 campuses for high performing charter schools {{ Charter schools in the United States }} and seeks to provide investors with a healthy return.

1986–1993: Breakthrough and the first major title
Agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at La Quinta, California.  He won his first match against John Austin {{ John Austin (tennis) }} , but then lost his second match to Mats Wilander.  By the end of the year, Agassi was ranked world no.  91.  He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the Sul American Open {{ ATP Itaparica }} in Itaparica and ended the year ranked world no.  25.  He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, U. S.  Mens Clay Court Championships {{ 1988 U. S.  Mens Clay Court Championships }} , Forest Hills WCT {{ World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988 }} , Stuttgart Outdoor, Volvo International {{ 1988 Volvo International }} and Livingston Open {{ 1988 Livingston Open }} ), and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1 nbsp;million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.  During the year, he set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager, a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005.  His year-end ranking was world no.  3, behind second-ranked Ivan Lendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander.  Both the Association of Tennis Professionals and Tennis magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.  In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon {{ The Championships, Wimbledon }} from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the events traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform. Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion.  While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open {{ US Open (tennis) }} in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989.  He began the 1990s with a series of near-misses.  He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off.  He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals.  His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro.  Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.  The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade.  Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final. In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier.  Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final.  Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear.  He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit.  He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to David Wheaton. Agassis Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success.  In 1992, he defeated Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final.  Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: Boris Becker and John McEnroe.  No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until Lleyton Hewitt ten years later.  Agassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year {{ BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality }} in 1992.  Agassi once again played on the United States Davis Cup winning team in 1992.  It was their second Davis cup title in three years. 1993 saw Agassi win the only doubles title of his career, at the Cincinnati Masters, partnered with Petr Korda.  Agassi missed much of the early part of that year with injuries.  Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and world no.  1 Pete Sampras in five sets.  Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.
1994–1997: Rise to the top, Olympic Gold and the fall
With new coach Brad Gilbert on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence.  He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon.  Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the Canadian Open {{ Canada Masters }} .  His comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open {{ 1994 US Open (tennis) }} with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot Michael Chang.  He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an unseeded {{ Seed (tennis) }} player, beating Michael Stich in the final.  Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players. In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old "image is everything" style.  He competed in the 1995 Australian Open (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four-set final.  Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on hardcourt, with Agassi winning three.  Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 (Cincinnati {{ Cincinnati Masters }} , Key Biscayne {{ Miami Masters }} , and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.  He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late night four-set semifinal of the US Open {{ 1995 US Open (tennis) }} against Boris Becker.  The streak ended the next day when Agassi lost the final to Sampras. Agassi reached the world no.  1 {{ List of ATP number 1 ranked players }} ranking for the first time in April 1995.  He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks.  Agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sampras surpass him and finish ranked no.  1 at the year-ending ranking.  In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassis best year.  He won 73 matches while losing 9 and was also once again a key player on the United States Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassis career. 1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final.  He suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals.  At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final.  The high point for Agassi was winning the mens singles gold medal at the Olympic Games {{ 1996 Summer Olympics }} in Atlanta, beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final.  Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne. 1997 was the low point of Agassis career.  His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year.  He later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine {{ methamphetamine }} at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.  He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink.  The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning.  In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie.  He quit the drug soon after.  At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game.  He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to world no.  141 on November 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sports premier competitors was over and that he would never again win any significant championships.
1998–2003: Return to glory and Career Super Slam
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the worlds top 50.  After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter. In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from world no.  110 to no.  6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.  At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to Tommy Haas.  He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne {{ Miami Masters }} , losing to Marcelo Ríos, who became world no.  1 as a result.  At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988). Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career.  Only Laver, Agassi, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have achieved this feat during the open era {{ History of tennis#Open Era }} .  This win also made him the first (of only four, the next being Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts), a tribute to his adaptability, as the other four men won their Grand Slam titles on clay and grass courts.  Agassi also became the only male player to win the Career Super Slam, consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year-End Championship {{ ATP World Tour Finals }} .  Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.  He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open {{ 1999 US Open (tennis) }} , beating Todd Martin in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final.  Overall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the ATP Masters Series in Paris, where he beat Marat Safin.  Agassi ended 1999 as the world no.  1, ending Samprass record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–98).  This was the only time Agassi ended the year at no.  1. He began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final.  He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.  .  2000 also saw Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.  At the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup {{ 2000 Tennis Masters Cup }} in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat Safin in the semifinals to end the Russians hopes to become the youngest world no.  1 in the history of tennis.  Agassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end world no.  1. Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément.  En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussies last Australian Open.  At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set.  In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3-hour, 33 nbsp;minute epic match with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7, with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match.  Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked world no.  3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s).  He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year-old Connors finished at world no.  2 in 1984.  2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion.  Agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key Biscayne title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final.  The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings.  The match was the last of Samprass career.  Agassis US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, Rome {{ Rome Masters }} and Madrid {{ Madrid Open (tennis) }} , helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end world no.  2 at 32 years and 8 months.  In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final.  In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive Key Biscayne title, in the process surpassing his wife, Steffi Graf, who was a five-time winner of the event.  The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–95.  (Agassis winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to Agustín Calleri. ) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament. On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the world no.  1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over Xavier Malisse at the Queens Club Championships to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days.  He had held the world no.  1 ranking for two weeks, when Lleyton Hewitt took it back on May 12, 2003.  Agassi then recaptured the world no.  1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003.  During his career, Agassi held the world no.  1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks.  Agassis ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events.  He did manage to reach the US Open semifinals, where he lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero and surrendered his world no.  1 ranking to Ferrero.  At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked world no.  4.  At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was world no.  4 in 1987.
2004–2006: Final years
In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin; the loss ended Agassis 26-match winning streak at the event, a record that still stands.  He won the Masters series event in Cincinnati {{ Cincinnati Masters }} to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo {{ Monte Carlo Masters }} and Hamburg {{ Hamburg Masters }} .  At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by Ken Rosewall, who won the title in 1970 at age 35.  He finished the year ranked world no.  8, the oldest player to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was world no.  7 in 1988.  Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the open era {{ Tennis open era }} to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles. Agassis 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open.  Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury.  He lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of the French Open.  He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the Rogers Cup {{ Canada Masters }} , before falling to world no.  2 Rafael Nadal. Agassis 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final.  After beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final.  The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake {{ James Blake (tennis) }} , where he rallied from two sets down to win 7–6 in the fifth set.  His other five-set victims were Xavier Malisse in the fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semifinals.  In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years.  Federer defeated Agassi in four sets.  Agassi finished 2005 ranked world no.  7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at years end. Agassi had a poor start to 2006.  He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play.  Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season, including the French Open.  This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.  Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then Wimbledon {{ 2006 Wimbledon Championships – Mens Singles }} .  He was defeated in the third round by world no.  2 (and eventual runner-up) Rafael Nadal.  Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.  At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.  Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season, with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile.  As a result, he was unseeded at the US Open. Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open.  Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match.  After a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel, Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the second round, who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semifinals.  Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set.  In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets.  Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.
Equipment and endorsements
Agassi used Prince {{ Prince Sports }} Graphite {{ Prince original graphite }} rackets early in his career.  He signed a $7 million endorsement contract with Belgian tennis racquet makers Donnay {{ Donnay (sports) }} .  He later switched to Head Ti Radical {{ Head (company) }} racket and Heads LiquidMetal Radical racket, having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Head in 1993.  He renewed his contract in 1999 and in November 2003, he signed a lifetime agreement with Head.  He also endorses Penn tennis balls.  On July 25, 2005, Agassi left Nike {{ Nike, Inc.  }} after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas.  A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassis charities, and Adidas was more than happy to do so.  On May 13, 2013, Agassi rejoined Nike.  Agassi was sponsored by DuPont, Ebel, Mountain Dew in 1993, Mazda in 1997, Kia Motors in 2002, American Express and Deutsche Bank in 2003.  In 1990, he appeared in a television commercial for Canon Inc. , promoting the Canon EOS Rebel camera.  Between 1999 and 2000, he signed a multimillion-dollar, multiyear endorsement deal with Schick {{ Schick (razors) }} and became the worldwide spokesman for the company.  Agassi signed a multiyear contract with Twinlab and promoted the companys nutritional supplements.  In mid-2003, he was named the spokesman of Aramis Life, a fragrance by Aramis {{ Estée Lauder Companies }} and signed a five-year deal with the company.  In March 2004, he signed a ten-year agreement worth $1. 5 million a year with 24 Hour Fitness, which will open five Andre Agassi fitness centers by year-end.  Prior to the 2012 Australian Open, Agassi and Australian winemaker Jacobs Creek {{ Jacobs Creek (Australia) }} announced a three-year partnership and created the Open Film Series to "[share] personal stories about the life defining moments that shaped his character on and off the court. " In 2007, watchmaker Longines named Agassi as their brand ambassador.  Agassi and his mother appeared in a Got Milk? advertisement in 2002. Agassi has appeared in many advertisements and television commercials with Graf.  They both endorsed Deutsche Telekom in 2002, Genworth Financial and Canon Inc.  in 2004, LVMH in 2007, and Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit U and Longines in 2013.
Relationships and family
In the early 1990s Agassi dated American entertainer Barbra Streisand.  Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, he said, "We agree that were good for each other, and so what if shes twenty-eight years older? Were sympatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection.  It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo – another piece of my overall rebellion.  Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava. " Agassi was married to Brooke Shields from 1997 to 1999.  He married Steffi Graf on October 22, 2001, at their Las Vegas home, Graf being advanced in her pregnancy.  They have two children: son Jaden Gil (born 2001) and daughter Jaz Elle (born 2003).  Agassi has said that he and Graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players.  The Graf-Agassi family resides in Summerlin {{ Summerlin, Nevada }} , a community in the Las Vegas Valley.  Long-time trainer Gil Reyes {{ Gil Reyes (tennis) }} has been called one of Agassis closest friends; some have described him as being a "father figure" to Agassi.  In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes.  In December 2008, Agassis childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.
Autobiography
Agassis autobiography, Open: An Autobiography, (written with assistance from J.  R.  Moehringer ), was published in November 2009.  In it, Agassi admitted that he used and tested positive for methamphetamine in 1997.  In response to this revelation, Roger Federer declared himself shocked and disappointed, while Marat Safin argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles.  In an exclusive interview with CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that "It was a period in my life where I needed help. " He also revealed that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him.  He also revealed he wore a hairpiece earlier in his career and thought Pete Sampras was "robotic".  The book reached No.  1 on the New York Times Best Seller list {{ New York Times Best Seller list }} and received favorable reviews.  It won the Autobiography category of the 2010 British Sports Book Awards.
Grand Slam finals
By winning the 1999 French Open, Agassi completed a mens singles Career Grand Slam.  He is the 5th of 8 male players in history (after Budge {{ Don Budge }} , Perry {{ Fred Perry }} , Laver {{ Rod Laver }} , Emerson {{ Roy Emerson }} and before Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic) to achieve this.
Open Era records
These records were attained in the Open Era of tennis and in ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series since 1990.  Records in bold indicate peer-less achievements.

<TEXT>Intro
The Austroasiatic languages, in recent classifications synonymous with Mon–Khmer, are a large language family of continental Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the southern border of China.  The name Austroasiatic comes from the Latin words for "south" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".  Of these languages, only Vietnamese {{ Vietnamese language }} , Khmer {{ Khmer language }} , and Mon {{ Mon language }} have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively).  On the subnational level, Khasi {{ Khasi language }} has official status in Meghalaya while Santali {{ Santali language }} , Ho {{ Ho language }} and Mundari {{ Mundari language }} are official languages of Jharkhand.  In Myanmar, the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State.  The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status. Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages.  These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps Shompen {{ Shompen language }} , which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and Munda {{ Munda languages }} .  However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and Khasi–Khmuic {{ Khasi–Khmuic languages }} ) while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.  Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken.  They appear to be the autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia, with the neighboring Indo-Aryan {{ Indo-Aryan languages }} , Tai–Kadai {{ Tai–Kadai languages }} , Dravidian {{ Dravidian languages }} , Austronesian {{ Austronesian languages }} , and Sino-Tibetan languages being the result of later migrations.
Typology
The Austroasiatic languages are well known for having a "sesquisyllabic" {{ sesquisyllable }} pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable.  Many of them also have infixes.  The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register {{ Register (phonology) }} contrast, either between modal {{ modal voice }} (normal) voice and breathy {{ breathy voice }} (lax) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice.  Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.  However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, tonogenesis.  Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.
Proto-language
Much work has been done on the reconstruction of Proto-Mon–Khmer in Harry L.  Shortos Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary.  Little work has been done on the Munda languages, which are not well documented.  With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic. Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows: This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for .  is better preserved in the Katuic languages, which Sidwell has specialized in.  Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong, in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.
Internal classification
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, Northeast India {{ North-East India }} and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East {{ East India }} and Central India and parts of Bangladesh.  However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published. Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.  By contrast, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated.  In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional "Mon–Khmer" as a valid unit.  However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese {{ Acehnese language }} in Sumatra (Diffloth), the Chamic languages of Vietnam, and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).
Writing systems
Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient Khmer alphabet, Thai alphabet and Lao alphabet.  Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing.  This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century.  The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.  Chữ Nôm  Khmer alphabet  Mon script Ol Chiki alphabet (Santali {{ Santali language }} alphabet)  Sorang Sompeng alphabet (Sora {{ Sora language }} alphabet)  Varang Kshiti (Ho {{ Ho language }} alphabet)  Khom script (used for a short period in the early 20th century for indigenous languages in Laos)
Austroasiatic migrations
According to Chaubey et al.  (2010), "AA speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from Southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations. " According to Riccio et al.  (2011), the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from southeast Asia.  According to Zhang et al.  (2015), Austroasiatic (male) migrations from southeast Asia into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago.

Sidwell (2009, 2011)
Paul Sidwell (2009a), in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.  He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence.  Sidwell Blench {{ Roger Blench }} (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.  If this would the case, Sidwell Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward.  Sidwell Blench (2011) suggest Shompen {{ Shompen language }} as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating.  In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong River valley relatively quickly.  |3=Khmuic {{ Khmuic languages }} |4=Pakanic {{ Pakanic languages }} |6=Vietic {{ Vietic languages }} |7=Katuic {{ Katuic languages }} |8=Bahnaric {{ Bahnaric languages }} |9=Khmer {{ Khmer language }} |10=Pearic {{ Pearic languages }} |11=Monic {{ Monic languages }} |12=Aslian {{ Aslian languages }} |13=Nicobarese {{ Nicobarese languages }} |14=?Shompen {{ Shompen language }} }}}}
Previously existent branches
Roger Blench (2009) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on substrate {{ Stratum (linguistics) }} evidence in modern-day languages.  Pre-Chamic {{ Chamic language }} languages (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the Chamic {{ Chamic language }} migrations).  Chamic has various Austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing Austroasiatic branches (Sidwell 2006).   Acehnese {{ Acehnese language }} substratum (Sidwell 2006).  Acehnese has many basic words that are of Austroasiatic origin, suggesting that either Austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier Austroasiatic residents in northern Sumatra, or that words might have been borrowed from Austroasiatic languages in southern Vietnam — or perhaps a combination of both.  Bornean {{ Bornean languages }} substrate languages (Blench 2010).  Blench cites Austroasiatic-origin words in modern-day Bornean branches such as Land Dayak {{ Land Dayak languages }} (Bidayuh {{ Bidayuh languages }} , Dayak Bakatiq {{ Bakati’ language }} , etc. ), Dusunic {{ Dusunic languages }} (Central Dusun {{ Dusun language }} , Visayan {{ Brunei Bisaya language }} , etc. ), Kayan {{ Kayan–Murik languages }} , and Kenyah {{ Kenyah languages }} , noting especially resemblances with Aslian {{ Aslian languages }} .  As further evidence for his proposal, Blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in Borneo shared in common with Austroasiatic-speaking groups in mainland Southeast Asia.  Lepcha {{ Lepcha language }} substratum ("Rongic").  Many words of Austroasiatic origin have been noticed in Lepcha, suggesting a Sino-Tibetan {{ Sino-Tibetan languages }} superstrate laid over an Austroasiatic substrate.  Blench (2013) calls this branch "Rongic" based on the Lepcha autonym Róng. Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are: Jiamao {{ Jiamao language }} , based on evidence from the register system of Jiamao, a Hlai {{ Hlai languages }} language (Thurgood 1992).  Jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary.

This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact.

<TEXT>Intro
Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and traditionally as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic), is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.  It comprises about 300 or so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 Ethnologue estimate.  It includes languages spoken predominantly in West Asia {{ Western Asia }} , North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Afroasiatic languages have 350+ million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after Indo-European {{ Indo-European languages }} , Sino-Tibetan {{ Sino-Tibetan languages }} , and Niger–Congo {{ Niger–Congo languages }} ).  The phylum has six branches: Berber {{ Berber languages }} , Chadic {{ Chadic languages }} , Cushitic {{ Cushitic languages }} , Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }} , Omotic {{ Omotic languages }} and Semitic {{ Semitic languages }} . By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is Arabic {{ Arabic language }} , including literary Arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties {{ Varieties of Arabic }} .  It has around 200 to 230 million native speakers concentrated primarily in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Malta.  Tamazight {{ Central Atlas Tamazight }} and other Berber varieties are spoken in Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, and northern Niger by about 25 to 35 million people.  Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include: Hausa {{ Hausa language }} , the dominant language of northern Nigeria and southern Niger, spoken as a first language by 25 million people and used as a lingua franca by another 20 million across West Africa and the Sahel  Oromo {{ Oromo language }} of Ethiopia and Kenya, with about 33 million speakers total Amharic of Ethiopia, with over 25 million native speakers in addition to millions of other Ethiopians speaking it as a second language Somali {{ Somali language }} , spoken by 15. 5 million people in Greater Somalia  Modern Hebrew, spoken by around 9 million people worldwide.   Modern Aramaic, spoken by about 550,000 people worldwide.  This is not just one language — It includes a number of subdivisions {{ variety (linguistics) }} , with Assyrian Neo-Aramaic being the most spoken variety (232,300).  In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }} , Akkadian {{ Akkadian language }} , Biblical Hebrew, and Old Aramaic.  It is uncertain when or where the original homeland of the Afroasiatic family existed.  Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.
Etymology
During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the Berber {{ Berber languages }} , Cushitic {{ Cushitic languages }} and Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }} languages within a "Hamitic" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic {{ Semitic languages }} phylum.  The terms "Hamitic" and "Semitic" were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham {{ Ham (son of Noah) }} and Shem, two sons of Noah.  By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.  The scholar Friedrich Müller {{ Friedrich Müller (linguist) }} introduced the name "Hamito-Semitic" for the entire family in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft (1876).  Maurice Delafosse (1914) later coined the term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled "Afro-Asiatic").  However, it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg (1950) formally proposed its adoption.  In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.  Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker 1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972).  In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the familys constituent languages.  The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.
Distribution and branches
The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches: Berber {{ Berber languages }}  Chadic {{ Chadic languages }}  Cushitic {{ Cushitic languages }}  Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }}  Omotic {{ Omotic languages }}  Semitic {{ Semitic languages }} Although there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among linguists {{ linguistics }} who study Afroasiatic.  In particular: The Omotic language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family "are either absent or distinctly wobbly" (Hayward 1995).  Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e. g.  Theil 2006).   The Afroasiatic identity of Ongota {{ Ongota language }} is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data.  Harold Fleming {{ Harold C.  Fleming }} (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.  Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan {{ Nilo-Saharan languages }} substratum.  In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.   Beja {{ Beja language }} is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.  Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.  There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see § Subgrouping {{ # Subgrouping }} below).  This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the Indo-European languages, for instance.  Meroitic {{ Meroitic language }} has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification. ==Classification history== In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh {{ Judah ibn Kuraish }} of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic.  He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic. In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships.  In 1844, Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter "Ethiopic").  In the same year, T. N.  Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty. Friedrich Müller {{ Friedrich Müller (linguist) }} named the traditional "Hamito-Semitic" family in 1876 in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft.  He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.  These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited (see Hamitic hypothesis). Leo Reinisch (1909) proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg, but his suggestion found little resonance. Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Joseph Greenberg (1950) strongly confirmed Cohens rejection of "Hamitic", added (and sub-classified) the Chadic branch, and proposed the new name "Afroasiatic" for the family.  Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenbergs classification. In 1969, Harold Fleming {{ Harold C.  Fleming }} proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name Omotic {{ Omotic languages }} .  This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance. Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic. Glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge.  It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: South Omotic {{ South Omotic languages }} , Mao {{ Mao languages }} , Dizoid {{ Dizoid languages }} , Gonga–Gimojan {{ Gonga–Gimojan languages }} (North Omotic apart from the preceding), Ongota {{ Ongota language }} , Kujarge {{ Kujarge language }} .
Position among the worlds languages
Afroasiatic is one of the four major language families {{ Languages of Africa }} spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book The Languages of Africa (1963).  It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatics Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe. There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family.  However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made.  The best-known of these are the following: Hermann Möller (1906) argued for a relation between Semitic {{ Semitic languages }} and the Indo-European languages.  This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e. g.  Holger Pedersen {{ Holger Pedersen (linguist) }} and Louis Hjelmslev).  (For a fuller account, see Indo-Semitic languages. ) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as grammatical gender, noun-adjective agreement, three-way number distinction, and vowel alternation as a means of derivation).  Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the University of Copenhagen), Holger Pedersen {{ Holger Pedersen (linguist) }} included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed Nostratic macro-family (cf.  Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the Indo-European, Uralic {{ Uralic languages }} , Altaic {{ Altaic languages }} , Yukaghir languages, and Dravidian Languages.  This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky.  Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called Eurasiatic {{ Eurasiatic languages }} , and to which he added Chukotian {{ Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages }} , Gilyak {{ Nivkh language }} , Korean {{ Korean language }} , Japanese-Ryukyuan {{ Japonic languages }} , Eskimo–Aleut {{ Eskimo–Aleut languages }} , and Ainu {{ Ainu languages }} .  Most recently, Sergei Starostin {{ Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin }} s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic.  The even larger Borean super-family contains Nostratic as well as Dené-Caucasian {{ Dené–Caucasian languages }} and Austric {{ Austric languages }} .
Date of Afroasiatic
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian {{ Egyptian language }} inscription dated to c.  3400 BC (5,400 years ago).  Symbols on Gerzean {{ Gerzeh culture }} (Naqada II) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs {{ Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution }} date back to c.  4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating.  This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.  However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic {{ Proto-Afroasiatic language }} (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.  Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.  They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).  According to Igor M.  Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c.  {{ circa }} 10,000 BC.  Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c.  11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c.  16,000 BC.  These dates are older than those associated with most other proto-languages.
Afroasiatic Urheimat
The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (Urheimat meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages.  Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia {{ Western Asia }} , North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.  Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the Sahara pump {{ Sahara pump theory }} operating over the last 10,000 years. There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed.  Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.
Similarities in grammar and syntax
Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include: A set of emphatic consonants, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.  VSO {{ Verb–subject–object }} typology {{ linguistic typology }} with SVO {{ subject–verb–object }} tendencies.  A two-gender {{ grammatical gender }} system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.  All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a causative affix s.  Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support possessive suffixes.  Morphology {{ Morphology (linguistics) }} in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or gemination) as well as with prefixes and suffixes. One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/. According to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages.  The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically {{ phoneme }} .
Shared vocabulary
The following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs. :Source: Christopher Ehret, Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995). :Note: Ehret does not make use of Berber in his etymologies, stating (1995: 12): "the kind of extensive reconstruction of proto-Berber lexicon that might help in sorting through alternative possible etymologies is not yet available. " The Berber cognates here are taken from previous version of table in this article and need to be completed and referenced. :Abbreviations: NOm = North Omotic, SOm = South Omotic.  MSA = Modern South Arabian, PSC = Proto-Southern Cushitic, PSom-II = Proto-Somali, stage 2.  masc.  = masculine, fem.  = feminine, sing.  = singular, pl.  = plural.  1s.  = first person singular, 2s.  = second person singular. :Symbols: Following Ehret (1995: 70), a caron ˇ over a vowel indicates rising tone {{ Tone (linguistics) }} , and a circumflex ^ over a vowel indicates falling tone.  V indicates a vowel of unknown quality.  ? indicates a glottal stop.  indicates reconstructed forms {{ Linguistic reconstruction }} based on comparison of related languages {{ Comparative method (linguistics) }} .  There are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova.  The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything.  The following table contains the thirty roots or so (out of thousands) that represent a fragile consensus of present research:

Subgrouping
Little agreement exists on the subgrouping {{ subgrouping (linguistics) }} of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic.  However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first. Otherwise: Paul Newman {{ Paul Newman (linguist) }} (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic.  Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.   Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or "Erythraean", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian.  He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed Ongota {{ Ongota language }} as a new third branch of Erythraean.  He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.  Like Harold Fleming, Christopher Ehret (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean.  He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic.  He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and "Boreafrasian. " According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.  Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian.  They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a Sprachbund rather than a language family.  Igor M.  Diakonoff (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA).  He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.  Lionel Bender {{ Lionel Bender (linguist) }} (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as "Macro-Cushitic".  He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.  Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of lexicostatistics, groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.  He places Ongota in South Omotic.

<TEXT>Intro
Andorra ( ; , ), officially the Principality of Andorra ( ), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra ( ), is a sovereign landlocked {{ landlocked country }} microstate in Southwestern Europe {{ Iberian Peninsula }} , located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France.  Created under a charter in 988, the present principality was formed in 1278.  It is known as a principality as it is a monarchy {{ coregency }} headed by two Co-Princes {{ Co-Princes of Andorra }} the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgell in Spain, and the President of France. Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe {{ European microstates }} , having an area of 468 nbsp;km 2 (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately 85,000.  Its capital Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of above sea level {{ above mean sea level }} .  The official language is Catalan {{ Catalan language }} , although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.  Andorras tourism {{ Tourism in Andorra }} services an estimated 10. 2 million visitors annually.  It is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is the official currency.  It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.  In 2013, the people of Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world {{ List of countries by life expectancy }} at 81 years, according to The Lancet.
Etymology
The origin of the word Andorra is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated.  The oldest derivation of the word Andorra is from the Greek historian Polybius (The Histories {{ The Histories (Polybius) }} III, 35, 1) who describes the Andosins, an Iberian {{ Iberians }} Pre-Roman tribe {{ Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula }} , as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars.  The word Andosini or Andosins (Ἀνδοσίνους) may derive from the Basque {{ Basque language }} handia whose meaning is "big" or "giant".  The Andorran toponymy shows evidence of Basque language in the area.  Another theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old word Anorra that contains the Basque word ur (water).  Another theory suggests that Andorra may derive from Arabic al-durra, meaning "The forest" (الدرة).  When the Moors colonized the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and other regions and towns, also administered by Muslims, received this designation.  Other theories suggest that the term derives from the Navarro-Aragonese andurrial, which means "land covered with bushes" or "scrubland".  The folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite {{ Cannan }} valley of Endor {{ Endor (village) }} or Andor {{ Endor (village) }} (where the Midianites had been defeated), a name also bestowed by his heir and son Louis le Debonnaire after defeating the Moors in the "wild valleys of Hell".
Politics

This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as Prince of Andorra, an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people.  The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary {{ parliamentary system }} representative democracy, whereby the Head of Government {{ List of heads of government of Andorra }} is the chief executive {{ head of government }} , and of a pluriform {{ wiktionary:pluriform }} multi-party system. The current Head of Government is Antoni Martí of the Democrats for Andorra (DA).  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament. The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council.  The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors.  The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council. Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency.  15 days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration.  During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected.  Eight days later, the Council convenes once more.  During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.  Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors.  The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government.  The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra.  The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws.  Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra. The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality.  The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires.  If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved.  Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it. If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections.  In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office.  After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.
Law and criminal justice
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court.  The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates.  It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms. The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court.  The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General.  The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties.  It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council.  They serve eight-year terms.  The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.
Foreign relations, defence, and security
Andorra does not have its own armed forces, although there is a small ceremonial army.  Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.  However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the Sometent (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.  This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need.  Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).
Economy
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorras tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP.  An estimated 10. 2 nbsp;million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorras duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.  Andorras relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground.  The sport brings in over 7 million visitors and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2000 direct and 10000 indirect jobs at present . The banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP ).  The financial system comprises five banking groups, one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.  Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported.  Some tobacco is grown locally.  The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising.  Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorras natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.  Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship {{ Andorra–European Union relations }} with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.  Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EUs single currency, the euro.  Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002.  Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014. Andorra has traditionally had one of the worlds lowest unemployment rates.  In 2009 it stood at 2. 9%.  Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs.  However, during the European sovereign-debt crisis of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran duty-free shopping.  This led to a growth in unemployment.  On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced, followed by a sales tax of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.  On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.  The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government Antoni Marti and the French President and Prince of Andorra, François Hollande.  Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra "bringing its taxation in line with international standards".
Healthcare
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social (CASS), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.  The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents.  The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance.  Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.  The main hospital, Meritxell, is in Escaldes-Engordany.  There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the principality.
Transport
Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation.  Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours drive from Andorra. Andorra has a road network of , of which is unpaved.  The two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near El Pas de la Casa.  Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times.  There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and Toulouse, plus a daily tour from the former city.  Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government. There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorras borders but there are, however, heliports in La Massana (Camí Heliport), Arinsal and Escaldes-Engordany with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of Alt Urgell, south of the Andorran-Spanish border.  Since July 2015, Andorra–La Seu dUrgell Airport has operated commercial flights to Madrid {{ Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport }} and Palma de Mallorca {{ Palma de Mallorca Airport }} , and is the main hub {{ airline hub }} for Air Andorra and Andorra Airlines. Nearby airports located in Spain and France provide access to international flights for the principality.  The nearest airports are at Perpignan {{ Perpignan–Rivesaltes Airport }} , France ( from Andorra) and Lleida {{ Lleida-Alguaire Airport }} , Spain ( from Andorra).  The largest nearby airports are at Toulouse, France ( from Andorra) and Barcelona {{ Barcelona Airport }} , Spain ( from Andorra).  There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra. The nearest railway station is LHospitalet-près-lAndorre east of Andorra which is on the -gauge {{ Standard gauge }} line from Latour-de-Carol, ( ) southeast of Andorra, to Toulouse and on to Paris by the French high-speed trains {{ TGV }} .  This line is operated by the SNCF.  Latour-de-Carol has a scenic trainline {{ Yellow Train }} to Villefranche-de-Conflent, as well as the SNCFs gauge line connecting to Perpignan, and the RENFEs {{ RENFE }} -gauge {{ Iberian gauge }} line to Barcelona.  There are also direct Intercités de Nuit {{ Intercités#Night trains }} trains between LHospitalet-près-lAndorre and Paris on certain dates.
Media and telecommunications
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as Andorra Telecom (STA).  The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio. By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100 nbsp;Mbit/s, and the availability was complete in June 2012. There is only one Andorran television station, Ràdio i Televisió dAndorra (RTVA).  Radio Nacional d’Andorra operates two radio stations, Radio Andorra and Andorra Música.  There are three national newspapers, Diari dAndorra, El Periòdic dAndorra, and Bondia {{ Bondia (newspaper) }} as well as several local newspapers.  There is also an amateur radio society.  Additional TV and radio stations from Spain and France are available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV.
Culture
The official and historic language is Catalan.  Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity. Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially.  Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially Catalan {{ music of Catalonia }} in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana.  Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Annes dance in Escaldes-Engordany.  Andorras national holiday is Our Lady of Meritxell Day, 8 September.  American folk artist Malvina Reynolds, intrigued by its defence budget of $4. 90, wrote a song "Andorra".  Pete Seeger added verses, and sang "Andorra" on his 1962 album The Bitter and the Sweet.
Sports
Andorra is famous for the practice of Winter Sports.  Popular sports played in Andorra include football {{ Association football }} , rugby union, basketball and roller hockey {{ Roller hockey (quad) }} . In roller hockey {{ Roller hockey (quad) }} Andorra usually plays in CERH Euro Cup {{ CERH European Roller Hockey Championship }} and in FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup.  In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the 2011 European League Final Eight.  The country is represented in association football by the Andorra national football team.  However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorras small population.  Football is ruled in Andorra by the Andorran Football Federation founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football (Primera Divisió, Copa Constitució and Supercopa {{ Andorran Supercup }} ) and futsal.  FC Andorra, a club based in Andorra la Vella founded in 1942, compete in the Spanish football league system. Rugby {{ Rugby union }} is a traditional sport in Andorra, mainly influenced by the popularity in southern France.  The Andorra national rugby union team, nicknamed "Els Isards", has impressed on the international stage in rugby union and rugby sevens.  VPC Andorra XV is a rugby team based in Andorra la Vella actually playing in the French championship. Basketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s, when the Andorran team BC Andorra played in the top league of Spain (Liga ACB).  After 18 years the club returned to the top league in 2014.  Other sports practised in Andorra include cycling, volleyball, judo, Australian Rules football, handball, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and motorsports.  In 2012, Andorra raised its first national cricket team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club, the first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of .  Andorra first participated at the Olympic Games in 1976.  The country has also appeared in every Winter Olympic Games since 1976.  Andorra competes in the Games of the Small States of Europe being twice the host country in 1991 {{ 1991 Games of the Small States of Europe }} and 2005 {{ 2005 Games of the Small States of Europe }} . As part of the Catalan cultural ambit, Andorra is home to a team of castellers, or Catalan human tower builders.  The Castellers dAndorra {{ :ca:Castellers dAndorra }} , based in the town of Santa Coloma dAndorra, are recognized by the Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya {{ :ca:Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya }} , the governing body of castells.
Prehistory
La Balma de la Margineda {{ La Margineda }} found by archaeologists at Sant Julia de Loria were the first temporal settled in 10000 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees.  The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from Ariege {{ Ariège (river) }} and Segre {{ Segre (river) }} .   During the Neolithic Age the group of humans moved to the Valley of Madriu {{ Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley }} (nowaday Natural Parc located in Escaldes-Engordany declared UNESCO World Heritage Site) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC.  The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the Segre and Occitania.  Other archaeological deposits include the Tombs of Segudet (Ordino) and Feixa del Moro (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900-4300 BC as an example of the Urn culture {{ Urnfield culture }} in Andorra.  The model of small settlements begin to evolved as an complex urbanism during the Bronze Age.  We can found metallurgical {{ Metallurgy }} items of iron, ancient coins and relicaries in the ancient sanctuaries {{ Sanctuary }} scattered around the country.  The sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes (Stone of the Witches) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this Age in Andorra, located in the parish of Canillo, about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone murals.
The Iberian and Roman Andorra
The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the Iberians and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the VII and II centuries BC.  Influenced by Aquitanias {{ Aquitanian language }} , Basque {{ Basque language }} and Iberian languages the locals developed some current toponyms.  Early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer Polybius in his Histories during the Punic Wars.  Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc dEnclar (part of the early Marca Hispanica), lAnxiu in Les Escaldes and Roc de LOral in Encamp.  It is known the presence of Roman {{ Roman Empire }} influence from the II century BC to the V century AD.  The places found with more Roman presence are in Camp Vermell (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria and in some places in Encamp as well as in the Roc dEnclar.  People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of Urgellet (nowaday La Seu dUrgell) and all across Segre through the Via Romana {{ Roman roads }} Strata Ceretana (also known as Strata Confluetana).
The Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne
After the fall of the Roman Empire Andorra was under the influence of the Visigoths {{ Visigothic Kingdom }} , not directly from the Kingdom of Toledo {{ History of Toledo, Spain#Visigothic Toledo }} by distance, but more particular from the Diocese of Urgell.  The Visigoths remained during 200 years in the valleys, a period in which Christianization {{ Gothic Christianity }} takes place within the country.  The fall of the Visigoths came from the Muslim Empire {{ Al-Andalus }} and its conquest {{ Umayyad conquest of Hispania }} of the Iberian Peninsula.  Andorra remained away from these invasions by the Franks {{ Francia }} .  Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people, under the command of Marc Almugaver and an army of five thousand soldiers, in return for fighting against the Moors near Porté-Puymorens (Cerdanya).   Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the Frankish Empire being overlordship {{ Feudalism }} of the territory the Count of Urgell and eventually by the bishop {{ Bishop of Urgel }} of the Diocese of Urgell.  Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, writing the Carta de Poblament or a local municipal charter circa 805.  In 988, Borrell II, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.  Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu dUrgell, has been Co-prince {{ Co-Princes of Andorra }} of Andorra.  The first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu dUrgell (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu dUrgell).  The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old parishes {{ Parishes of Andorra }} of the Andorran valleys and thebefore the administrative division of the country.
Medieval Age: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality
Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, asked the Lord of Caboet for help and protection.  In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra.  Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya.  Years later their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II {{ Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix }} , the French Count of Foix.  They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell). In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix as aftermath of the Cathar Crusade.  The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of Aragon {{ Kingdom of Aragon }} , Pere II {{ Pere el Gran }} King of the Bishop and the Count, by the signing of the first paréage {{ Paréage of Andorra 1278 }} which provided that Andorras sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia.  This gave the principality its territory and political form.    A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the Count of Foix {{ Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix }} ordered the construction of a castle in Roc dEnclar.  The document was ratified by the noble notary Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà {{ County of Cerdanya }} and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.  In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic (nowadays spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of local departments {{ Parishes of Andorra }} (comuns, quarts and veïnats).  After being ratified by the Bishop Francesc Tovia and the Count Jean I {{ John I, Count of Foix }} , the Consell de la Terra or Consell General de les Valls {{ General Council (Andorra) }} (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe.  The syndic Andreu dAlàs and the General Council organized the creation of the Justice Courts {{ Politics_of_Andorra#Judicial_branch }} (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the Co-Princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally fire and site, a national tax active since then).  Although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the IX century (Sant Vicenç dEnclar or Església de Santa Coloma), Andorra developed an exquisite Romanesque Art {{ Romanesque Art and Architecture }} during the IX and XIV centuries, as much in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child (being the most important the Our Lady of Meritxell).  Nowadays, the Romanesque {{ List_of_regional_characteristics_of_Romanesque_churches#Romanesque_churches_in_Spain. 2C_Portugal_and_Andorra }} buildings that form part of Andorras cultural heritage {{ Cultural Heritage of Andorra }} stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve, Sant Joan de Caselles, Església de Sant Miquel dEngolasters, Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda {{ Pont de la Margineda }} and Escalls {{ Pont dels Escalls }} among many others.  While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the Catalan language at the end of the XI century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Kingdom of Aragon.  The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in the livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers.  Later, at the end of the XI century, the first foundries of iron {{ Bloomery#Medieval_Europe }} began to appear in Northern Parishes like Ordino, much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the XV century.
17th to 19th centuries
With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre {{ Kingdom of Navarre }} .  After Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, he issued an edict in 1607, that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as Co-Princes of Andorra.  In 1812–13, the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four départements, with Andorra being made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre). Andorra retained its medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period.  In 1866, a Council General of 24 members, elected by suffrage limited to heads of families, replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.
20th century
Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting.  It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the Treaty of Versailles.  In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections.  On 12 July 1934, adventurer Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell.  He was arrested by the Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain.  From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain.  Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.  During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain. Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal.  In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation.  Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.
Military
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army.  The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the Sometent.  Being a landlocked country, Andorra has no navy. Prior to World War I Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen.  This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (viguiers) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgel.  Despite not being involved in any fighting during the First World War {{ World War I }} , Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference, technically {{ de jure }} remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until the 24th of September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.  In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.  Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities. The armys role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931.  Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National Gendarmerie, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.  The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.  The force consisted of six Corporals, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major.  It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish. Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service, with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm.  The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions.  According to Marc Forné Molné, Andorras military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.  The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.  In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers {{ Officer (armed forces) }} , or non-commissioned officers, because the other ranks {{ Enlisted rank }} are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.
Police Corps
Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants.  The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing.  There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.
Fire brigade
The Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at Santa Coloma {{ Santa Coloma dAndorra }} , operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters.  The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.  Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires.  The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943.  Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961.  The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigades headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.
Parishes
Andorra consists of seven parishes: Andorra la Vella Canillo Encamp Escaldes-Engordany La Massana Ordino Sant Julià de Lòria
Physical geography
Due to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at , and the average elevation of Andorra is .  These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Gran Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorras lowest point of ).  Andorras land area is . Phytogeographically {{ Phytogeography }} , Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom.  According to the WWF {{ World Wide Fund for Nature }} , the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.
Climate
Andorra has an alpine climate and continental climate.  Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.
Population
The population of Andorra is estimated at 85,458 (2014).  The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900. Two-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections.  Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.
Languages
The historic and official language is Catalan {{ Catalan language }} , a Romance language.  The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan.  It funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra (Catalan: la Comissió de Toponímia dAndorra), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants.  Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan. Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish {{ Spanish language }} , Portuguese {{ Portuguese language }} and French {{ French language }} are also commonly spoken.  Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan.  English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts.  Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities {{ Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities }} .  According to the Observatori Social dAndorra, the linguistic usage in Andorra is as follows:
Religion
The population of Andorra is predominantly (88. 2%) Roman Catholic.  Their patron saint is Our Lady of Meritxell.  Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group .  Other Christian denominations include the Anglican Church, the Unification Church, the New Apostolic Church, and Jehovahs Witnesses.  The small Muslim community {{ Islam in Andorra }} is primarily made up of North African immigrants.  There is a small community of Hindus {{ Hinduism }} and Baháís {{ Baháí Faith in Andorra }} and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.  (See History of the Jews in Andorra. )
Schools
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education.  Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government. There are three systems of schools Andorran, French, and Spanish which use Catalan, French, and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction.  Parents may choose which system their children attend.  All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain.  About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.
University of Andorra
The Universitat dAndorra (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra.  It was established in 1997.  The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses.  The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.
Major achievements
Ariadna Tudel Cuberes and Sophie Dusautoir Bertrand earned the bronze medal in the womens team competition at the 2009 European Championship of Ski Mountaineering.  Joan Verdu Sanchez earned a bronze medal in Alpine Skiing {{ Alpine skiing at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics }} at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics.  In 2015, Marc Oliveras earned a silver medal in Alpine Skiing {{ Alpine skiing at the 2015 Winter Universiade }} at the 2015 Winter Universiade, while Carmina Pallas earned a silver and a bronze medal in the same competition.
GIPA
The Grup dIntervenció Policia dAndorra (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in counter-terrorism, and hostage recovery {{ Hostage negotiator }} tasks.  Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the Police Corps {{ Police Corps of Andorra }} , and not the army {{ Military of Andorra }} .  As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.
Virtual Studies Centre
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities.  The Virtual Studies Centre (Centre d’Estudis Virtuals) at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies.  The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

<TEXT>Intro
In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( ), or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection.  The collection is often a set of results of an experiment {{ experiment (probability theory) }} , or a set of results from a survey {{ Survey methodology }} .  The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other mean {{ average }} s, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean. In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, sociology, and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent.  For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population. While the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies {{ central tendency }} , it is not a robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values).  Notably, for skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially greater than most peoples, the arithmetic mean may not accord with ones notion of "middle", and robust statistics, such as the median, may be a better description of central tendency. In a more obscure usage, any sequence of values that form an arithmetic sequence {{ Arithmetic progression }} between two numbers x and y can be called "arithmetic means between x and y. "
Definition
The arithmetic mean (or mean or average) is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency.  In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency.  The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations.  Symbolically, if we have a data set containing the values a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n , then the arithmetic mean A is defined by the formula:: A=\frac \sum_ ^n a_i=\frac (See summation for an explanation of the summation operator). For example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400.  The arithmetic mean is: \frac =2530.  If the data set is a statistical population (i. e. , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the population mean.  If the data set is a statistical sample {{ sampling (statistics) }} (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean. The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example as in \bar (read x bar), which is the mean of the n values x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n .
Motivating properties
The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency.  These include: If numbers x_1,\dotsc,x_n have mean \bar , then (x_1-\bar ) + \dotsb + (x_n-\bar ) = 0 .  Since x_i-\bar is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean.  The mean is the only single number for which the residuals {{ errors and residuals in statistics }} (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.  If it is required to use a single number as a "typical" value for a set of known numbers x_1,\dotsc,x_n , then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of (x_i-\bar )^2 .  (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error. ) If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is unbiased {{ unbiased estimate }} is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.
Contrast with median
The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median.  The median is defined such that half the values are larger than, and half are smaller than, the median.  If elements in the sample data increase arithmetically {{ arithmetic progression }} , when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal.  For example, consider the data sample .  The average is 2. 5 , as is the median.  However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly.  In this case, the arithmetic average is 6. 2 and the median is 4.  In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them. There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields.  For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.
Angles
Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or angles.  Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°. This is incorrect for two reasons: Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of 360° {{ degree (angle) }} (or 2π, if measuring in radians).  Thus one could as easily call these 1° and −1°, or 361° and 719°, each of which gives a different average.  Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better average value: there is lower dispersion {{ statistical dispersion }} about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average). In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range.  A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz. , define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i. e. , the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

Weighted average
A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation.  For example, the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5 is \frac = 4 , or equivalently \left( \frac \cdot 3\right) + \left( \frac \cdot 5\right) = 4 .  In contrast, a weighted mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as \left( \frac \cdot 3\right) + \left(\frac \cdot 5\right) = \frac .  Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are (2/3) and (1/3) , the former being twice the latter.  Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the "unweighted average" or "equally weighted average") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to \frac in the above example, and equal to \frac in a situation with n numbers being averaged).
Continuous probability distributions
When a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same.  In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution.  The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the mean of the probability distribution.  The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode {{ Mode (statistics) }} , are equal to each other.  This property does not hold however, in the cases of a great many probability distributions, such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here.
