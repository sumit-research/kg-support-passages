These are often described as stateless societies {{ stateless society }} , although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical {{ Hierarchy }} free associations {{ Free association (communism and anarchism) }} .

Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).</TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous {{ Traditional knowledge }} , feminist {{ feminism }} , ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.  Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.  Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight {{ G8 }} , and the World Economic Forum.</TEXT>

<TEXT> However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.  This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".  Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.</TEXT>

<TEXT> This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".  Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.  Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, market {{ market (economics) }} s, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".   Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom.  Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.</TEXT>

<TEXT> The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, Autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and CDD {{ Childhood disintegrative disorder }} , has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.  The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.  These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.  Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.</TEXT>

The average albedo of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere, its planetary albedo, is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.</TEXT>

Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation.

Research showed impacts of over 10%.  More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation).  In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.  Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration.</TEXT>

<TEXT> "A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, etc.  Such associations can have a motivating {{ motivation }} effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.  Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.</TEXT>

<SECTITLE>Typographic variants</SECTITLE>
<TEXT>During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A".  First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums.  There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces.  Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule {{ letter case }} cursive, minuscule {{ letter case }} cursive, and semicursive minuscule.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe {{ Muskogean languages }} whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa {{ Coosa River }} and Tallapoosa {{ Tallapoosa River }} rivers on the upper reaches of the river.  In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).  The word Alabama is believed to have come from the Alabama language, and a suggestion the name was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely.</TEXT>

<TEXT> In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the states gross domestic product.  The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.  Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles battle prize Briseis, daughter of Briseus be brought to him to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.  At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnons theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.</TEXT>

In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once".  By the end of 1863, at Lincolns direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots.  The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.  Defying Lincolns prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.</TEXT>

As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.</TEXT>

The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As quoted from Charles Lyells {{ w:Charles Lyell }} Principles of Geology: He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages.  He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized.  He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time nbsp;.</TEXT>

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain "imprints", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity.

<TEXT>Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer.  He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works.  Gershwin explained in Musical America, "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.</TEXT>

The radio broadcast of the September nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which An American in Paris, also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.</TEXT>

He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history.

The 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972. TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth.  Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used.</TEXT>

<TEXT>TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth.  Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.</TEXT>

Altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e. g. , pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness {{ fitness (biology) }} of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.  In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping {{ Tip (gratuity) }} , courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.

<TEXT> Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons.  Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism).  Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pathological {{ Pathology }} altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good. The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book Pathological Altruism. Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain.  From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the Pauline {{ Paul the Apostle }} phrase "love seeks not its own interests. " In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, a Vedantic text.  In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed.  Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are Rachid Boudjedra, Rachid Mimouni, Leila Sebbar, Tahar Djaout and Tahir Wattar. Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure.  Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, the swallows of Kabul and the attack of Yasmina Khadra, the oath of barbarians of Boualem Sansal, memory of the flesh of Ahlam Mosteghanemi and the last novel by Assia Djebar nowhere in my fathers House.</TEXT>

Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the National Museum of Natural History (France) by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau.

<TEXT>Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of Anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting {{ Fossil collecting }} , exploring {{ Exploration }} , documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and religious studies, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.  Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).  For example, the classic of urban anthropology, Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology mentions that the "Third World" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon.  Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of painting, sculpture, or literature, conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.  To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being artistic, have certain evident aesthetic qualities.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves.  Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "descent {{ kinship }} ", "descent groups", "lineage {{ lineage (anthropology) }} s", "affine {{ affinity (law) }} s", "cognates {{ cognatic kinship }} ", and even "fictive kinship".  Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (ones social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.</TEXT>
